Loving coped by “eating (her) feelings,” and she began gaining weight. Then after pregnancy, she noticed that she struggled to lose the baby weight. </p> <p class="""">“When I was pregnant with my son, I put on a ton of weight,” Loving, 45, from Huntington Beach, California, tells TODAY.com. “I reached the highest I had ever been which was 269.” </p> <p class="""">She joined WeightWatchers off and on over the years. In 2016, she joined for the last time and eventually lost 122 pounds. That weight loss helped her when she was diagnosed with breast cancer a year later. </p> <p class="""">“I firmly believe that this would have been a different outcome had I not lost all that weight,” she says. “The doctors have said, ‘I think your weight loss saved your life.’ Because I don’t know if I still had been 260 pounds that anything would have been found in that mammogram.” </p> <p class="""">In her junior year of high school, Loving stopped playing sports and being as active and noticed she gained a little bit of weight. But when her mom died of breast cancer, she gained some more weight. She didn’t truly notice the gain until after she became pregnant. She joined WW for the first time in 2003 and got down to her goal weight. </p> <p class="""">“(I) was super happy,” she says. “I got pregnant again with my daughter and unfortunately I feel like I didn’t learn as much as I thought I did because I kind of crept back into those same habits.” </p> <p class="""">Loving didn’t re-gain all the weight she lost and weighed about 215 pounds following her daughter’s birth. Again, she joined WW and lost the weight only to re-gain it again. </p> <p class="""">“I probably joined four or five different times. I would join. I would lose a little. I would quit,” she says. “The hardest thing was always walking back in that door.” </p> <p class="""">Something clicked when she joined in 2016. At the time, she weighed 262 pounds and lost 100 pounds by December of that year. Since then, she shed 22 more pounds and now weighs 140 pounds. </p> <p class="""">“I have maintained my weight lost since rejoining in 2016,” she says. </p> <p class="""">During this time, she also underwent regular mammograms. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 39 so Loving began screening at 29. </p> <p class="""">“The rule of thumb is when it’s a mother they start screening the daughters 10 years before your mother’s diagnosis,” Loving explains. “My very first screening I ended up having to have a biopsy done because they (saw) as suspicious area.” </p> <p class="""">Luckily, that area was just calcification and she resumed regular screenings. In 2017, the mammogram detected another spot that also seemed like calcification, at first. </p> <p class="""">“They called me back after the initial mammogram and said, ‘Hey we see this little funky area we want to get a magnified mammogram of it,” Loving says. </p> <p class="""">She underwent a needle-guided biopsy, which detected abnormal cells, but wasn't definitive. She decided to undergo a surgical biopsy and then learned some devastating news: Loving, then 38, had breast cancer. </p> <p class="""">“It was probably one of the hardest days of my life and the thing I dreaded most was telling my husband and telling my dad because my dad had gone through so much with my mom,” she says. “I was so scared. There wasn’t a day that went by where I didn’t cry.”  </p> <p class="""">Loving had stage 1 hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Even though she had the surgical biopsy, she still needed to undergo a lumpectomy to make sure there were clear margins, meaning all the cancer had been removed. They also removed a few lymph nodes to make sure that the cancer had not spread. She opted to have reconstruction surgery done at the same time. The mass in the right breast was so large that they were removing so much tissue her breasts would be two different sizes so the plastic surgeon slightly reduced her left breast and did a lift on both. </p> <p class="""">When pathology returned, though, Loving faced difficult news. </p> <p class="""">“(My surgeon) was in tears practically. She said, ‘Tamara I don’t know what to tell you other than we didn’t get margins on that area, and we have to go back in,’” she recalls. “I was completely devastated.” </p> <p class="""">Loving worried they if they tried again for a lumpectomy they still wouldn’t have clear margins and she’d need to undergo surgery again. So, she decided to do a double mastectomy with reconstruction. </p> <p class="""">“It was the most difficult decision I ever made in my life,” she says. She was able to do the reconstruction right after the mastectomy in part because she was in “exceptional health.” </p> <p class="""">“My blood pressure, the weight loss, my health was so good that they felt comfortable keeping me under as long as they did,” she says. </p> <p class="""">She didn’t need to undergo chemotherapy or radiation after surgery and has been cancer free since. </p> <p class="""">“They keep giving me a clean bill of health so that makes me one happy lady,” Loving says. </p> <p class="""">While “2017 was one of the worst years of (her) life,” Loving has been thriving since undergoing her mastectomy and reconstruction. She has maintained her healthy eating and exercise habits and has been cancer-free. </p> <p class="""">“I am so much stronger than I give myself credit for,” she says. “Life hasn’t really been the easiest. I suffered a lot of loss.” </p> <p class="""">Before 2016, Loving did not have a consistent exercise routine but now she exercises five days a week in the gym, a combination of cardio and weight training, while enjoying leisure activities, such as walking on the beach with her husband. She encourages others hoping to adopt healthy habits and lean on others for support. </p> <p class="""">“I just can’t stress enough the community and how much WeightWatchers members support one another,” she says. </p> <p class=""endmark""><strong>CORRECTION</strong> (Nov. 2 2023, 8:49 a.m.): This article was updated to reflect the age Loving was when her mother died of breast cancer.

But one recent style making a comeback that hasn't made me cringe is the <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-denim-maxi-skirts-t283127?"" target=""_blank"">denim maxi skirt</a> — and I'm a child of the '90s!</p> <p class="""">After seeing them all over fashion segments and on one of my favorite celebrity's Instagram account, I decided I needed one for my <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/sweater-dresses-women-t238173"" target=""_blank"">fall wardrobe</a>, too. Since the skirt style is a bit bold for my taste, I didn't want to spend too much money on one in case I only wore it once and then decided the trend wasn't for me. That’s why I turned to Amazon for its affordability and hidden fashion gems. </p> <p class="""">I was being extremely picky in my search and most of the jean skirts I came across either had a huge slit up my thigh or looked a little too prairie-like for me — then I came across this classic style and the silhouette was just what I was looking for. </p> <p class="""">When I first put it on, I instantly felt like a ""cool girl"" and oh-so-trendy. I kept it simple and wore it with a black turtle neck and knee-high <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/womens-wide-calf-boots-t204950"" target=""_blank"">boots</a>. I rarely find outfits that are truly day-to-night but this skirt actually brought me from the office to a dinner, and I felt appropriately dressed for both occasions. </p> <p class="""">I instantly knew I'd get a lot of use out of this denim skirt and already can't wait to try it with heeled <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-chelsea-boots-t234248?"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea boots</a> and different <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-turtleneck-sweater-t193229"" target=""_blank"">chunky sweaters</a>. And not only is this the perfect <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/amazon-fall-fashion-beauty-essentials-t264497"" target=""_blank"">fall trend</a> piece, but I also think you could wear it well into spring and summer. It’d pair nicely with a white tee and <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-sneakers-rcna103718?"" target=""_blank"">sneakers</a>, or a tank and sandals, especially since it hits a few inches above the ankle. </p> <p class="""">At first glance, you'd think this skirt wouldn't be comfortable, but the fabric is a cotton-blend and extremely soft. It sits high-waisted and has an A-line silhouette, so it doesn't feel tight on your hips and back end. Some reviewers wrote that it runs a little big in the waist, and suggest to size down. I somewhat felt this way but I didn't want it too tight since I knew I wanted to wear tucked-in sweaters during the cooler months. </p> <p class="""">The only thing I struggled with while wearing this skirt was walking fast. If you walk at a normal speed, you'll be fine but for New York City speed walkers like me, the skirt doesn't let you take huge strides, which now I realize why some people might prefer ones with slits. But for a skirt this cute, I will happily walk a tad slower and not power walk to my destination.</p> <p class=""endmark"">If you are looking for a skirt with a slit or something more edgy, the brand offers a few other styles on their <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg118312"" href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5382GTT?tag=denimskirtodercna122861-20"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">product page</a>, including hemline-to-waist buttons on the side or the front. My style skirt even comes in black — so I'll definitely be buying that one to add to my fall wardrobe next!</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Shannon Garlin is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Their relationship played out in Season Five of ""Selling Sunset.""</p> <p class="""">Stause helped the drummer search for a new home in Los Angeles ahead of their upcoming move to the city, according to the couple’s interview with <a href=""https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/interviews/chrishell-g-flip-selling-sunset/news-story/3e156a518d3e7e8b9105a120e15983a0"" target=""_blank"">Vogue Australia</a>.</p> <p class="""">That's when Stause realized her feelings might go deeper than friendship.</p> <p class="""">“I specifically remember because it was the same feeling you would have when somebody you have a crush on gets a little too close into your space and you get a little … flustered,” she said.</p> <p class="""">As Stause began to develop romantic feelings for G Flip, there was one complication: Stause was in talks to appear in a new dating TV show, where the ultimate goal was finding love with a man.</p> <p class="""">“I was not letting myself fall too hard because I’m like, ‘I’m gonna have to say goodbye to Chrishell and let her go find her person on this dating show that she’s already signed up for,’” G Flip told Vogue Australia.</p> <p class="""">Stause said she felt stressed because she “was falling in love with G, but we were both playing it kind of cool.”</p> <p class="""">Finally, she and G Flip decided to prioritize their feelings for each other, and Stause walked away from the dating show.</p> <p class="""">“It was the best ‘no’ I’ve ever given,” she said. “That would’ve been a great opportunity to find someone. But this is what I was trying to find.”</p> <p class="""">By early 2022, Stause was dropping subtle hints on social media about her relationship with G Flip. </p> <p class="""">The “Selling Sunset” star included a selfie with the drummer in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CbQuh1LPcyc/?"" target=""_blank"">photo roundup on Instagram</a> on March 18, 2022.</p> <p class="""">“Grateful for every person in these pics!” she wrote in the caption.</p> <p class="""">Stause <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/who-is-g-flip-chrishell-stause-selling-sunset-dating-rcna27623"" target=""_blank"">went public with her relationship</a> with G Flip in the Season 5 cast reunion of “Selling Sunset” on May 6, 2022.</p> <p class="""">“I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that’s very important to me. Their name is G Flip,” Stause said. “They’re nonbinary, so they go by they/them, and they are an extremely talented musician.”</p> <p class="""">Stause’s “Selling Sunset” cast members were surprised yet supportive of their relationship.</p> <p class="""">“I’m still processing everything. I didn’t know,” former cast member Maya Vander said. “I’m happy for you. Whatever makes people happy.”</p> <p class="""">The realtor’s ex-boyfriend, Jason Oppenheim, also shared his support.</p> <p class="""">“The smile that’s been on your face makes me very happy. I’m very proud of you,” he said.</p> <p class="""">A few days after going public with their romance, Stause shared more about her relationship with G Flip, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/popculture/chrishell-stause-honest-video-addressing-sexuality-relationship-rcna28279"" target=""_blank"">and her own sexuality</a>, in an Instagram video.</p> <p class="""">“Some of you won’t understand this or agree with this, but for me, it is about the person,” Stause said in the video, which she shared on May 10, 2022. “It is about their heart. And yes, there’s that part of you that’s like, what you’re attracted to. But for me, I am attracted to masculine energy and I don’t really care what the physical form is.</p> <p class="""">“Everyone is different, but for (G Flip), they really feel like they are a mix, and they identify on both sides of male, female,” she added. “And so that’s one of those things I personally find such a beautiful mix, and I think it’s probably why we did connect on such a deep level so quickly.”</p> <p class="""">G Flip referred to themselves as nonbinary in an<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc15TeNOiDW/?"" target=""_blank""> April 2022 Instagram post</a>, and called themselves a “gender smoothie.”</p> <p class="""">“If strawberries were girls and blueberries were boys and you put them in a blender, you’d get a gender smoothie. I am a gender smoothie,” they wrote.</p> <p class="""">After going public with their relationship, Stause <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/popculture/chrishell-g-flip-music-video-rcna28532"" target=""_blank"">starred in G Flip’s music video</a> for their song, “Get Me Outta Here.”</p> <p class="""">The video featured several steamy scenes of the two, showing them making out in a convenience store and other locations.</p> <p class="""">The couple <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/chrishell-stause-g-flip-anniversary-rcna75145"" target=""_blank"">celebrated their first anniversary</a> in their Instagram stories on March 15, 2022.</p> <p class="""">“365 days adoring you,” G Flip posted in their story, sharing a photo of Stause smiling. </p> <p class="""">Stause also shared a picture of G Flip holding a vase full of red roses in her Instagram story.</p> <p class="""">“Our first year is gonna be hard to beat, but here’s to trying!” Stause wrote in the caption. “I love you babyyyyy.”</p> <p class="""">Not long after celebrating their first anniversary, Stause and G Flip dropped a <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/selling-sunset-chrishell-stause-marries-g-flip-rcna83879"" target=""_blank"">surprise wedding announcement</a> on Instagram.</p> <p class="""">Stause revealed that she and G Flip had tied the knot in an Instagram video on May 11, 2023. </p> <p class="""">The video, a montage of sweet moments the couple had shared throughout their relationship, ended with a photo of Stause and G Flip kissing at an altar, with Stause dressed in a long white gown and G Flip in a dark suit.</p> <p class="""">“Love doesn’t always go as planned … Sometimes it’s immeasurably better,” Stause captioned the post. </p> <p class="""">The video was set to G Flip’s song “Be Your Man.”</p> <p class="""">Congratulations poured in from the “Selling Sunset” cast.</p> <p class="""">“I am SO excited for this!! You and G are the most inspiring couple and the affection between you both is so pure,” Jason Oppenheim wrote in the comments. “I love you two tons and am so lucky to have you both in my life. congrats!”</p> <p class="""">“IM DYING!!!!!! I’ve been waiting for this post all day!!!” cast member Emma Hernan also commented. “Covered in goosebumps since the moment I watched! Watching your love is like watching the best love story in the world!”</p> <p class="""">In Season Six of “Selling Sunset,” Stause opened up about possible plans to expand their family, saying she and G Flip were <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/selling-sunset-chrishell-stause-g-flip-adopt-children-rcna85049"" target=""_blank"">open to adoption</a>.</p> <p class="""">Stause has been open in the past about her desire to have children. This proved to be a <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/why-did-chrishell-jason-break-up-selling-sunset-rcna24584"" target=""_blank"">dealbreaker in her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jason Oppenheim</a>, who had expressed his reluctance to have children at that time.</p> <p class="""">She and Oppenheim now seem to be on friendly terms, and Stause reflected on their relationship in Season Six.</p> <p class="""">“You weren’t open to adoption. Which I get! A lot of people aren’t,” she said. “But that’s a pressure cooker for someone in my position.”</p> <p class="""">Now, with G Flip, Stause said things were different.</p> <p class="""">“With G I feel like that pressure is off,” she said. “When we want to do it, we want to adopt.”</p> <p class="""">“You could babysit from time to time,” she added to Oppenheimer.</p> <p class="""">G Flip appeared a few times in Season Six of “Selling Sunset” but wasn't heavily featured.</p> <p class="""">Before appearing at all on the reality show, G Flip said they had one request.</p> <p class="""">“Going into it, I always said, If I do ‘Selling Sunset’, I just want to do scenes with Chrishell because I don’t want to be put into any drama. I’m not a dramatic person,” they <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/g-flip-drummer-album-interview-rcna101593"" target=""_blank"">told TODAY.com in August 2023</a>. “It was nice to just do scenes with Chrishell because if I felt uncomfortable you know, my wife, my support system’s right in front of me.”</p> <p class="""">The musician opened up about what it’s like being the spouse of a reality star.</p> <p class="""">“I just feel like just this drummer from Australia (who’s) fallen in love with the most gorgeous, precious, beautiful human in the world and found myself in a strange position,” they said.</p> <p class="""">Stause has also said there were times she protected her spouse from drama during the filming of “Selling Sunset.”</p> <p class="""">In fact, her determination to keep G Flip out of any conflict meant leaving one storyline from “Selling Sunset” on the cutting room floor.</p> <p class="""">“When G decided to film on the show, the one caveat that I’m very protective over, it cannot have anything to do with drama at all,” Stause said in an interview with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs1eVr67YnY"" target=""_blank"">SiriusXM’s Hits 1 LA</a> in May 2023. </p> <p class="""">“And I’m happy to take that heat because at the end of the day, if G is going to be so gracious as to join this crazy world I’m in, it is my job to protect them,” she continued.</p> <p class="""">Stause explained that she and fellow realtor Amanza Smith had an “issue” with each other (which Stause says they have since dropped) as they began working on a design project together.</p> <p class="""">Due to this conflict, Stause said she and Smith weren’t speaking  to each other at one point. And rather than pull G Flip into their dispute, Stause decided to not continue filming “with the drama going.”</p> <p class="""">In <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgPmNTJ1Lh/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2"" target=""_blank"">an Instagram post for G Flip’s birthday</a>, Stause celebrated her spouse’s kindness.</p> <p class="""">“You are every dog and every child’s favorite person in every room. That says so much! Impossible to count how many times my jaw has dropped and stopped dead in my tracks at how you so casually do the most incredible things like it’s nothing, because to you it is,” she wrote in the caption.</p> <p class="""">She also noted G Flip’s “unbelievable talent and the purest caring heart.”</p> <p class=""endmark"">“I know I found my unicorn and am constantly in awe of you,” Stause also wrote. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY my love! To a million more lifetimes trying to figure out how I got so lucky.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Lindsay Lowe has been a regular contributor to TODAY.com since 2016, covering pop culture, style, home and other lifestyle topics.

At least 117 million Americans used eyedrop products in 2020, according to <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/285907/usage-of-eye-drops-and-eye-wash-in-the-us-trend/"" target=""_blank"">Statista</a>, a data research company. The group expects that number will rise to more than 123 million in 2024.</p> <p class="""">In 2023, however, the FDA came out with several dire warnings about contamination of these commonly used products.</p> <p class="""">No infections associated with this latest round of eyedrop recalls have been reported. Still, experts remain concerned.</p> <p class="""">“We haven’t seen bad effects from these products yet,” said Dr. Ronald Benner, president of the American Optometric Association. “But the fear is that we will.”</p> <p class="""">“We urge consumers to stop using these products, as it could result in an eye infection,” the FDA said in an emailed statement.</p> <p class="""">It is unclear what prompted the agency to look closely at this particular facility, which has not been named.</p> <p class="""">When bacteria enter our bodies through cuts in the skin or through food we eat, our immune systems are trained to kick in. White blood cells surge to form scabs. Stomach acids attack.</p> <p class="""">But eyes are particularly vulnerable to foreign invaders. They “don’t have that level of protection,” said Dr. Morgan Morelli, assistant professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. “You’re putting the product straight onto the eye.”</p> <p class="""">An outer layer of the eye, called the corneal dome, does not have blood vessels that are usually critical in the immune system process because the eye “has to maintain a crystal clarity,” Benner said.</p> <p class="""">When allergens prompt people to rub and itch their eyes, it can cause tiny scratches on the surface of the eye, opening the door wide for bacterial infections.</p> <p class="""">“When you have an infection in that tissue, the body can’t fight it as quickly,” Benner said. “Putting a drop in that’s contaminated makes things worse.”</p> <p class="""">Given the recalls, experts say the first thing consumers should do is check their medicine cabinets, purses, desk drawers, junk drawers and any other places eyedrops may be kept. <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-certain-eye-drops-several-major-brands-due-risk-eye#eyedrops"" target=""_blank"">This is a list</a> of the latest drops the FDA says to stop using.</p> <p class="""">Experts also recommend using only brand name eyedrops and other artificial tear products.</p> <p class="""">“There are some generics out there that are probably fine and safe, but you never know where they are manufactured,” Benner said. “You never know how long they’ve been on the shelf.”</p> <p class="""">Morelli agreed, even though brands tend to be more expensive than generics. She said she paused recently when faced with spending $30 on eyedrops for herself. “When it comes to the eyes, you’re probably safer spending more money and going with a brand name,” Morelli said.</p> <p class="""">Starr, also an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, reminds all patients to check the expiration dates on eyedrop bottles.</p> <p class="""">“If expired, please discard them, as there is a higher risk of contamination even with nonrecalled, well-manufactured eyedrops,” he said.</p> <p class="""">Other expert tips:</p> <p class=""endmark""><strong><em>Follow </em></strong><a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>NBC HEALTH</em></strong></a><strong><em> on </em></strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsHealth"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em> &amp; </em></strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsHealth/"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

While the latter can last two weeks, postpartum depression is stronger, chronic and can develop during pregnancy or one year post-birth. </p> <p class="""">Symptoms vary from ""intense irritability and anger"" to believing one is not a good mother, facing fears of being a bad mother or dealing with anxiety or panic attacks.  </p> <p class="""">""I’ve talked to her about it,"" Shields told Glamour of her conversation with Rowan. ""And after the documentary, Chris was really worried, and he was upset with me because he thought I didn’t warn the kids enough.</p> <p class="""">""I said, 'Rowan, I need to tell you, I never didn’t love you. I was very sick,'"" added Shields. ""And she goes, 'Mom…' I said, 'And I never wanted to hurt you.' She goes, 'Well, I made it this far.' She said, 'And Mom, I get it.' </p> <p class="""">""But women need to hear this,"" Shields continued. ""They need to know, because it’s scary.""</p> <p class="""">In her documentary, Shields explained that after a 24-hour labor and an emergency cesarean section, Rowan was born. As those around her celebrated the birth, Shields felt something was wrong. </p> <p class="""">""They thought it was the baby blues, they all thought, 'All the moms cry' and 'All the moms are exhausted,"" said Shields in doc. ""I just got back to our apartment and I just gave Chris the baby and ... I just went to bed.""</p> <p class="""">Shields said she withdrew from people, including her baby, crying and experiencing intrusive thoughts about her daughter getting hurt. </p> <p class="""">""What kind of a mother has these thoughts?"" said Shields in the documentary. ""I'm supposed to want to live, breathe, sleep with her.""</p> <p class="""">Shields believed she was going ""truly insane"" with fearful thoughts, saying, ""Nobody understood me and my husband was just so at a loss,"" especially after observing how other mothers cared for their babies. Shields said she believed that Rowan didn't need her as a mother. </p> <p class="""">Eventually, she went to therapy after a doula suggested that Shields had postpartum depression. </p> <p class="""">""There is a myth around the ease with which birthing a child and falling in love with your child and being maternal naturally to your child that came out of your body (is) and it's really a frightening thing to have the picture look different,"" Shields said in ""Pretty Baby.""</p> <p class="""">Shields told Glamour that, to this day, other mothers thank her for talking about postpartum depression during a time when it felt taboo. </p> <p class="""">""They go, 'I had it so bad and I didn’t know. And I felt like I was so wrong and my husband didn’t understand and I felt so guilty,'"" Shields told the publication. ""And the tears, and it’s like, God, I feel for you. Because they carry it with them, and you carry a lot of guilt about it.""</p> <p class="""">In April, Shields shared that her documentary also upset Grier, her youngest daughter. ""Pretty Baby"" also covers Shields' sexualization as a child star in films like ""Pretty Baby (1978) and ""The Blue Lagoon (1989) and her sexual assault as a college graduate.  </p> <p class="""">“Grier looked at it as all the things that I kept from her,” Shields said on <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/brooke-shields-documentary-pretty-baby-daughter-reaction-rcna78138"" target=""_blank"">TODAY</a>. “She was outraged and she was very sad.</p> <p class=""endmark"">""She said, ‘Nothing you say to me, Mom, is going to make it better,’” added Shields. “She said, ‘I hate seeing bad things happen to you.’""</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Elise Solé is a writer and editor who lives in Los Angeles and covers parenting for TODAY Parents.

Before you reach for a cure in the drugstore aisle, Rebecca Robbins, Ph.D., a sleep scientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, tells TODAY the best sleep aid is “natural sleep, which comes with practicing healthy sleep strategies.” Some of these habits include:</p> <p class="""">Think of all of this as sleep training — but for adults.</p> <p class="""">Robbins said many of us are falling short of adequate sleep, which is between seven and nine hours for adults, and as many as 30% of us <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/4-tips-help-you-beat-insomnia-fall-asleep-today-t209017"" target=""_blank"">struggle with insomnia symptoms</a> each night.</p> <p class="""">Like eating well or moving more, a good night’s sleep is crucial to good health. <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/best-long-term-health-benefits-sleep-today-t211765"" target=""_blank"">Sleep affects everything</a> from how we learn to our mood to our immune system<a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-happens-your-body-brain-while-you-sleep-ncna805276"">,</a> so it’s definitely worth moving sleep up a notch on your to-do list.</p> <p class="""">Unless you have a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/could-sleep-doctor-help-solve-your-sleep-problems-t211732"" target=""_blank"">medical condition that’s preventing you from getting in those zzz’s</a>, a lot of common sleep issues can be tackled by building better sleep habits.</p> <p class="""">This weeklong sleep plan will help you unlock the secrets to better sleep by giving you the tools to understand your individual sleep patterns. Over the next week, you’ll start to uncover what’s keeping you up at night — and make the transition from bleary-eyed and tired to well-rested and ready to take on the new day.</p> <p class="""">This journey is all about mindfulness. Every morning for the next seven days, you’ll ask yourself these three questions: When did I go to sleep? How did I sleep? And how did I feel when I woke up? Jot the answers down in this handy downloadable and printable sleep diary and you’ll get insights into what’s keeping you up at night (and the knowledge you need to fix it).</p> <p class="""">Starting tonight, commit to not tossing and turning in bed if you wake up at night. If you wake up and can’t get back to sleep, get out of bed, move to another room and focus on a relaxing activity like reading until you feel sleepy enough to return to bed. Avoid watching TV or using your cellphone.</p> <p class="""">If you find it hard to get to sleep, add one of these <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/breathing-exercises-rcna47881"">breathing activities</a> to your bedtime routine.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23702643/sleep-journal-jp-new-230309.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>&gt;&gt;Download and print the journal. </em></strong></a></p> <p class="""">The light from your TV or phone makes it harder to unwind and fall asleep. Your challenge for today is to shut down your devices or whatever else is keeping you up (looking at you, pandemic) at least one hour before bedtime to give your brain (and body) the best chance for some quality sleep. If you’re still scrolling through work emails, Robbins had this advice: “Anything that can wait, write down exactly what it is on a notepad, no matter how large or small. ... The act of writing down these tasks — or really anything on your mind — can help take off the pressure and help you slip into sleep.”</p> <p class="""">Do you enjoy an afternoon coffee or a glass of wine with dinner? Some people can tolerate both without it affecting their sleep much. But if you find yourself struggling to stay awake during the day, it’s worth tracking what you drink in your sleep diary this week. Avoid caffeinated beverages, like tea, coffee and energy drinks, a few hours before bedtime — and <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/dry-january-what-it-what-are-benefits-women-t146331"" target=""_blank"">go easy on alcohol</a>, which has a relaxing effect, but may cause you to wake up in the middle of the night, Robbins said. </p> <p class="""">To sleep better, you need to set your internal body clock — which might be just a bit wonky with the time change. One way to do it? Getting outside in the natural light within the first hour of waking can be key to getting your sleep schedule on track.</p> <p class="""">Something as simple as a warm cup of herbal tea can set the mood for better sleep. “These habits send signals to our brains that it is time to start to power down, and that soon, sleep will come. Also, a warm cup of tea can help you ease hunger for sugary things or sweets after dinner which would not be recommended for your sleep,” Robbins said. Not a fan of herbal tea? Swap it with one of <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/5-ways-combat-covid-related-insomnia-fall-asleep-faster-t202278"" target=""_blank"">these relaxing habits instead</a>.</p> <p class="""">Has exercise taken a backseat lately? Hitting the pavement during the day can make hitting the sheets later a whole lot easier. A study found people who got 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise every week slept better. Make sure to get outside for a walk — or any exercise you enjoy — today and every day.</p> <p class=""""><strong><em>&gt;&gt; Need exercise inspiration? </em></strong><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cross-training-workout-plan-rcna121963"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Try our November walking challenge. </em></strong></a></p> <p class="""">By the end of the plan, you’ll have a week’s worth of data to review in your sleep diary. You’ll want to look for patterns over the course of the week to see what pops up. For example, do you sleep less on weekdays when you down on that double espresso to combat the afternoon slump? Or maybe sleeping in on weekends wreaks havoc on Monday morning? Taking stock of these changes can help you get to the bottom of what’s keeping you up at night.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Happy snoozing!</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Margaret O'Malley is an editor at TODAY and NBC News BETTER covering health and wellness, food and personal finance. </p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

When following this meal plan, you eat no more than 1,200 calories a day, including snacks.</p> <p class="""">How many calories should you be eating a day? The average woman needs between 1,600 and 2,400 calories a day to maintain their weight, and the average man needs between 2,000 and 3,000, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. So it goes without saying that the 1,200-calorie meal plan is restrictive for many people, and that's why it can result in fast weight loss.</p> <p class="""">To follow a low-calorie diet as safely as possible, you need to be vigilant about making sure you're consuming an <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/why-are-gums-bleeding-5-signs-missing-nutrients-t210839"" target=""_blank"">adequate amount of nutrients </a>to maintain your overall health. As a result, there's very little wiggle room to eat foods that aren't nutrient dense. Nutrient deficiency and a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/metabolism-slows-lose-weight-rcna13824"" target=""_blank"">slower metabolism</a> are two major drawbacks of following a 1,200-calorie meal plan.</p> <p class="""">If you're considering a 1,200 calorie meal plan, here's what else you need to know.</p> <p class="""">A 1,200-calorie plan is a form of low-calorie diet that's pretty self-explanatory. You try to eat no more than 1,200 calories in one day — which, for the average adult, is the lowest calorie level at which it may still be possible to meet most of your nutrient needs through food.</p> <p class="""">When carefully planned, a 1,200-calorie menu includes sufficient protein to minimize any muscle you might naturally lose on a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/it-ok-lose-weight-quickly-what-you-need-know-today-t209814"" target=""_blank"">fast weight-loss plan</a>, and it will hit most of your vitamin and mineral targets. However, because of the low calorie levels, it’s pretty inflexible, and it doesn’t have any room for fun foods that are devoid of nutrition.</p> <p class="""">For people who have a lot of metabolic complications, such as <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/my-doctor-told-me-i-have-prediabetes-what-do-i-t197306"" target=""_blank"">pre-diabetes</a> or type 2 diabetes, a diet plan like this may help with weight loss and managing blood-sugar levels. In one year-long <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3940825/"" target=""_blank"">trial</a> among more than 2,000 obese patients, the average weight loss was about 32 pounds after a year of eating this way. And many health measures, like HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, improved during the study period. Blood glucose levels among those with type 2 diabetes also improved.</p> <p class="""">However, study conditions don't always match real life. For example, support from a registered dietitian and psychologist was built into the study program, and the dieters had the opportunity to participate in classes on behavior modification. They were given carefully designed soups, snack bars and other meals to help them reach these goals, which means they didn’t have to do meal prep like most of us do — and they had a system in place for dealing with social and emotional triggers, like a food-filled birthday party or rough day at work.</p> <p class="""">Another <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157789/"" target=""_blank"">study</a> on a commercially-based low-calorie diet suggested that success depended on regular meetings with the health counselor, indicating that this support is key.</p> <p class="""">Some research in animals also suggests that low-calorie meal plans may boost your lifespan. A <a href=""https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2022/active-phase-calorie-restriction.html"" target=""_blank"">May 2022 study in mice</a> out of UTSouthwestern Medical Center found that restricting calories by 30% to 40% and eating only when the circadian rhythm is active extended lifespan by 35% when compared to mice that could eat whenever and as much as they wanted. The research also found that the mice with restricted calories had better metabolic health, more sensitivity to insulin and blood sugar stability.</p> <p class="""">What’s even more important than whether you can lose weight on a 1,200-calorie meal plan is if it’s possible for you to maintain most of what you lost, and therefore, continue to experience health benefits.</p> <p class="""">In one carefully designed small <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707677/"" target=""_blank"">study</a> among people who lost 10% of their body weight using a low-calorie diet — and who later attempted to maintain the weight loss over a nine-month period that did not include dietary counseling — participants regained on average about half the weight they’d lost.</p> <p class="""">About <a href=""https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2018/weight-cycling-is-associated-with-a-higher-risk-of-death"" target=""_blank"">80% of people who try to lose weight</a> will regain it. Weight loss sets off a cascade of biological events that promote weight regain. For example, your metabolism slows down to account for your smaller size. That means you need to eat fewer calories as you lose weight to match your body’s needs. This can be difficult under ordinary circumstances, but after losing weight, it’s much harder because your body responds to weight loss by <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/why-do-i-always-feel-hungry-why-you-eat-even-t173620"" target=""_blank"">increasing its hunger</a> hormones. So in essence, you need fewer calories than when you set out to lose weight, but as you do lose weight, you become even hungrier.</p> <p class="""">And, as noted with the above meal plans, even if you carefully outline your 1,200-calorie meal plan, it can be difficult to get the recommended daily allowance of all your nutrients. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/nutrition.htm"" target=""_blank"">Poor nutrition</a> can increase risk of several chronic health conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer, according to the CDC.</p> <p class="""">There can also be drawbacks to this meal plan if 1,200 calories a day is too big of a calorie deficit for your body. You might experience fatigue, nausea, dehydration, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/health/how-often-should-you-poop-rcna84490"" target=""_blank"">constipation</a>, headaches and irritability, <a href=""https://health.clevelandclinic.org/calorie-deficit/"" target=""_blank"">according to the Cleveland Clinic</a>.</p> <p class="""">How much weight you'll lose on a 1,200-calorie meal plan depends on several factors, including how much you weigh and how active you are.</p> <p class="""">According to <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/calorie-counting-made-easy"" target=""_blank"">a report from Harvard Medical School</a>, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week (which most experts consider a safe rate), you need to eat 500 to 1,000 fewer calories a day than your weight-maintenance calorie count, or the amount of calories you should eat in a day to stay the same weight. To calculate your weight-maintenance calories, multiply your weight by 15.</p> <p class="""">If 1,200 calories a day is more than 500 calories lower than your weight-maintenance calories, you can expect to lose more than 1 to 2 pounds per week. If it's less, then you might lose fewer pounds a week.</p> <p class="""">Here’s a peek at what a 1,200-calorie weight-loss meal plan looks like.</p> <p class="""">Even though this menu is properly planned, it dips slightly below the daily recommended calcium, iron and magnesium levels. Ultimately, it’s difficult to achieve your nutrients from whole foods while staying within a 1,200-calorie limit.</p> <p class=""""><strong>Breakfast:</strong> 1/2 whole-wheat English muffin topped with 1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese, tomato slices and 1 teaspoon chia seeds.</p> <p class=""""><strong>Lunch:</strong> 1 can chunk white tuna, drained and mixed with 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar.

And I’d be like, ‘And the evening too!,’” Knowles said on ""Sherri.""</p> <p class="""">Knowles explained that things can be really hectic backstage, especially when Beyoncé is doing her quick outfit changes. The mom of two says she can understand why her daughter might be a tough at times. </p> <p class="""">""That’s the heat of the moment, because you’re trying to get your shoes on, and everybody’s waiting, and if somebody’s messing up, or they lose the shoes, then you messed up the whole show,” she said. “So, I understand it.”</p> <p class="""">However, once her comments on Bey's backstage behavior started to make headlines, Knowles took to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CzFegItRp0W/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> to clear up any potential misinterpretations about her remarks. </p> <p class="""">""You know, I’m gonna get in trouble when she sees this. So I would just clarify that she is not the only one fussing we all are,"" she said of life backstage on the tour. ""But it’s all love after she hits that stage and looks fabulous. But Quick change is not a place for people with sensitive temperaments. You have to be gangsta .!!! ❤️❤️.""</p> <p class="""">Knowles also clarified her comments on her daughter crying backstage. In the interview, she said that Beyoncé would always apologize for being mean to her after a performance.</p> <p class="""">“She’ll be like, ‘Mama, I’m so sorry,’ and I’m like, ‘I know.’ Sometimes she’ll be crying, and I was like, ‘She's crying because she knows she just said some crazy stuff to us,’” Knowles explained.</p> <p class="""">However, on Instagram, Knowles said there's more to the story.</p> <p class="""">""Don’t misunderstand, let me clarify !"" she wrote. ""She would not be crying because she got on our case , because we were screwing up . I was joking that when she was singing flaws and all that when she would cry on the song.""</p> <p class="""">""My joke was that it was because she had been mean to us, but that was just a joke people. . She don’t play when it comes to her shows ! She is a perfectionist, because she feels like she and her fans deserve the best,"" Knowles added. ""You have to have your stuff together to work for her ? She is a boss at all times and will not hesitate to get in your stuff if you mess up. ❤️❤️.""</p> <p class="""">On Instagram, fans supported Knowles and seemed to understand where she was coming from with her comments.</p> <p class="""">""Tina… we knew what you meant ! And for the record all of our mothers will get us in place ! She’s human, she’s not perfect , she has flaws and all … I actually thought is funny and reminded me of my mom,, after all you’re the real Matriarch!"" one person wrote.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Another said, ""Those of us in the industry understand Auntie.

However, that extra hour might see you rising earlier or otherwise changing your<a href=""https://www.today.com/health/sleep/7-day-sleep-plan-rcna73599"" target=""_blank""> sleep schedule</a>.</p> <p class="""">TODAY.com spoke to sleep experts to get all the details on how the time change affects our schedule and what steps you can take in advance to avoid altering your routine too much.</p> <p class="""">The reason we change the clocks back is to get some extra light: As winter approaches, it gets darker earlier, which can throw off the circadian rhythms that moderate our sleep and are affected by light.</p> <p class="""">“That <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/2020-daylight-saving-time-fall-back-push-end-time-change-t192958"" target=""_blank"">extra light in the morning is a benefit</a> and one of the main reasons why we have daylight saving time in the fall,” Eleanor McGlinchey, a professor of psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, New Jersey, explained. “I think for most people, we would prefer to sleep in a little bit more so this is the one that actually allows you to do that a little bit.”</p> <p class="""">Gaining an extra hour of sleep does affect us a bit, according to Courtney Bancroft, a clinical psychologist and sleep specialist based in New York City, but in general, the fall time change is much easier than the spring time change, where we lose an hour of sleep.</p> <p class="""">“There are many studies that show heart attacks and car accidents actually decrease by a significant percentage because of the extra hour of sleep that we gain when we shift the clocks back,” Bancroft said. “Likewise, there is a significant shift in the increase in heart attacks when we lose an hour of sleep in the spring forward time change.”</p> <p class="""">The biggest change in most sleep schedules is that you might find yourself naturally waking earlier, which Bancroft said can actually be helpful.</p> <p class="""">“If you think about the effects of alarm clocks, they can be really jarring to the system,” she said. “They can kind of cause surprise and the fight-or-flight system may jump in. ... But if we’re waking up naturally because of light coming in or because we’ve already reached our time limit for sleep, that can actually have a really gentle effect on the body.”</p> <p class="""">While gaining an hour of sleep is easier on your body and easier to adjust to than losing an hour of sleep in the spring, Bancroft provided three different plans you can follow if you want to make the switch even easier.</p> <p class="""">With this four-day plan, you’ll shift your bedtimes and wake times by 15 minutes each day.</p> <p class="""">If your original bed time is 11 p.m. and your wake time is 7 a.m., go to bed at 11:15 p.m. four days before the time change, and plan to wake at 7:15 a.m. Three days before, go to bed at 11:30 and wake at 7:30; two days before, sleep at 11:45 and wake at 7:45.</p> <p class="""">This two-day plan is simple but effective. If you typically go to bed at 11 p.m. and your wake time is usually 7 a.m., try staying up until 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 4, and sleep in until 7:00 a.m. on Nov. 5. This actually gives your body an extra half hour of sleep, which Bancroft says will help you “adjust more quickly, less drastically.”</p> <p class="""">Going forward, go back to your normal sleep schedule.</p> <p class="""">This plan is great for early risers: Go to bed on Nov. 4 at 11 p.m. and wake at 6 a.m. instead of your regular 7 a.m. time.</p> <p class="""">“For many, you may find that you’re naturally waking up earlier the morning after the time change for fall because of the light,” Bancroft said. “If you find yourself naturally waking up, get out of bed for the day. This will help your sleep drive shift to become ‘hungrier’ for sleep earlier that evening.”</p> <p class="""">Remember, the time change lasts all day, so if you’re used to going to sleep at 11 p.m., you may start feeling tired closer to 10 p.m. By waking up at 6 a.m., you’ll get the same amount of hours of time awake as you would have before the change. Go to bed around 10 p.m. and wake at 7 a.m. the next morning to get back on schedule.</p> <p class="""">McGlinchey said that it’s also important to make sure you don’t throw yourself off schedule in the days and weeks after the time change. Keep an eye on meal times, the amount of time you spend awake in bed and do what you can to wake naturally instead of using an alarm clock.</p> <p class="""">“Eating too early or <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/weight-loss-may-easier-eat-10-hour-window-study-finds-rcna51276"" target=""_blank"">eating too late</a> can have an impact on your circadian rhythms,” she said. “Try to keep technology out of your bed, make sure you’re not just hanging out in bed, because that can mess up your sleep and wake schedules.”</p> <p class=""endmark"">“As best as you can, try noticing when you naturally wake up and see if you can start to take advantage of that,” McGlinchey continued. “Say, ‘OK, if this is when I naturally wake up, when should I go to sleep?’ Try to stay consistent as best you can.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Kerry Breen is a reporter and associate editor for <a href=""http://today.com/"">TODAY.com</a>, where she reports on health news, pop culture and more.

But no — idk how to explain it but it's like he knows — right away when I undress him and put the little potty underneath he starts going.""</p> <p class="""">Her explanation continued: ""We potty trained the other kids around 22 months because it's our personal goal to have them out of diapers by 2, but we're super curious to see if Ernest is out of diapers earlier if we keep this up.""</p> <p class="""">Martinez cited the Instagram account of ""elimination communication expert"" <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/godiaperfree/"" target=""_blank"">Andrea Olson</a> as having ""a ton of info."" In her Instagram bio, Olson wrote: ""all 6 of my babies were outta diapers by 1 without potty training or💩💩dipes.""</p> <p class="""">Elimination communication is a method of potty training used in parts of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, according to <a href=""https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/potty-training/tips/elimination-communication-how-to-potty-train-without/"" target=""_blank"">Parents.com</a>. </p> <p class="""">It works like this: parents figure out their baby's cues when they are about to pee or poop. Once you figure out the cues and see them in action, you position baby over a potty and make a whistling or hissing sound. Eventually, baby will learn to pee and poop on demand.</p> <p class="""">Babies learning this method may still wear diapers, but in theory the diapers are more of an insurance plan than a first line of defense. Proponents say this method is less wasteful and more affordable than using diapers for two or three years.</p> <p class="""">Martinez noted that she was getting negative feedback from her story. In response to someone who wrote that putting Ernest on the potty was ""weird and abusive,"" Martinez replied that people in other countries who follow this practice ""probably think it's 'weird and abusive' that we let kids sit in their own pee and poop for 3-4 years.""</p> <p class="""">Although Martinez staunchly defended herself here, she has acknowledged that she does enjoy eliciting outraged responses.</p> <p class="""">“Do I do things sometimes like this to rile people up? Sure,” she wrote in an <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/bekah-martinez-responds-criticism-son-franklin-wearing-girly-bow-t194446"" target=""_blank"">Instagram story</a> defending her choice to put her 3-month-old son in a bow. “I love to see them mad. Don’t get it twisted. But with (my) leg hair, with putting Frank in a bow, with whatever the hell else I post, I also want to challenge people’s ideas of what’s right or wrong or what we should or shouldn’t do.”</p> <p class="""">Martinez is no stranger to getting strangers riled up online. There was <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/former-bachelor-contestant-bekah-martinez-gets-honest-about-surprise-pregnancy-t151252"" target=""_blank"">her surprise pregnancy</a> just three months into her relationship with her now-husband Grayston Leonard.

It's a tale as old as time .... </p> <p class="""">Though Mariyah, a competitive skater, had plans to attend college after high school, her grandmother had other ideas. She secretly signed Mariyah up for a ""Disney on Ice"" audition, which Mariyah aced. She had her audition the day before she graduated, left for tour two weeks later and performed in the show for six years.</p> <p class="""">Peter's love for skating began on a school field trip when he saw three-time world champion Elvis Stojko do a triple axel. He trained and competed internationally, eventually becoming a two-time Polish national champion in ice dance. He joined ""Disney on Ice"" after he stopped competing.</p> <p class="""">The two skaters were skating on different legs of the ""Disney on Ice"" tour until 2015, when Peter substituted for an injured skater in  Pensacola, Florida, where Mariyah happened to be performing.</p> <p class="""">After they started dating, the skaters were still performing with different partners for about a year. But then they received word that the show was about to end. </p> <p class="""">""We wanted to stay together, and the easiest way to stay together in  the professional skating world is to skate together because you're contracted together no matter what,"" Mariyah tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">""In the skating world, partners generally start skating first before they date, and we did it the opposite way. We started dating first and then we got the idea of starting to skate together,"" Peter laughs.</p> <p class="""">Learning to skate together wasn't easy. </p> <p class="""">Peter and Mariyah still had their ""regular job"" of performing in up to three shows a day, and then they stayed after work to skate together for an hour or two.</p> <p class="""">""That was a bit challenging, getting into being comfortable skating with one another and good enough that we could actually get a contract together,"" Mariyah says.</p> <p class="""">Their persistence paid off.</p> <p class="""">They earned a two-year contract as pair skaters with Royal Caribbean cruise lines, and then they toured with ""<a href=""https://holidayonice.com/"" target=""_blank"">Holiday on Ice</a>"" in Europe.</p> <p class="""">These days, Peter and Mariyah are still collaborating as full-time content creators and, of course, as parents. The Gerber Family still likes to lace up their skates from time to time.</p> <p class="""">In fact, Mariyah skated through her entire pregnancy. Her video elicited comments like, ""Gurl ... I was anxious watching this.""</p> <p class="""">Peter and Mariyah put skates on adorable Aiden when he was just 12 months old. At the time, he had only just started walking, ""So we just kind of played around with it,"" Mariyah says.</p> <p class="""">Today, Aiden is much more confident at walking — and skating.</p> <p class="""">The “ice” that you see the Gerbers skating on is actually <a href=""https://www.polyglidesyntheticice.com/products/polyglide-synthetic-ice-starter-kits?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgqGrBhDtARIsAM5s0_nKgE8OiidlXUM0tPzN8QJ_PPPrki3FNoAUVpW35gFDGpHJ1E3s74EaAqIAEALw_wcB"" target=""_blank"">synthetic</a>. “It’s called PolyGlide Ice. They’re basically puzzle pieces and you just clip them together,” Mariyah says. </p> <p class="""">It's especially sweet that the family can continue skating together given that the Gerbers' performing career ended so abruptly.</p> <p class="""">""Our last performing show was with 'Holiday on Ice' in Europe,"" Peter explains. ""It was in 2020 when the world stopped, and we never got our last show.""</p> <p class="""">Even once the world and their ice-skating options began reopening, the Gerbers knew that ""the options are pretty limited for parents in this space,"" Mariyah says. Touring ice skaters either had to leave their children at home or find one of the very few shows that do not travel.</p> <p class="""">Because they “still had that performing bug,” Peter says, they started creating videos for social media.  </p> <p class="""">""We're just grateful that we get to share something that we love and have loved for many years, but also have it as our job,"" Mariyah says.</p> <p class="""">And their Disney roots are still with them. </p> <p class=""endmark"">""We hadn't watched Disney movies in a long time and then we had a kid and now we watch them every day,"" Mariyah adds.

Swaynie first watched ""Friends"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living alone, the ""Friends"" cast became the friends they were lacking. ""It felt like I wasn't alone,"" they tell TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">Chandler was the character they related to most, in terms of outlook <em>and </em>wardrobe. “I’m definitely the type to make a joke when something bad was happening. He was good about making dark times a little better,” they say.</p> <p class="""">Further, Swaynie says Perry’s <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/behavior/matthew-perry-sobriety-rcna122772"" target=""_blank"">journey with addiction and sobriety</a> mirrored one she saw in a loved one. That made Perry’s death harder.</p> <p class="""">Given their connection to the character and actor, the idea for a Chandler Halloween costume seemed obvious. ""I hoped it wouldn't be seen as offensive. This is in memory of him,"" they say. ""I felt like celebrating him is the best thing to do right now."" </p> <p class="""">Swaynie has taken Halloween pop culture-inspired Halloween costumes seriously before. Years earlier, they shaved their head completely to be Uncle Fester. </p> <p class="""">This costume required much less work — just a trip to the closet. The difference here, they say, is that the costume is healing. ""My way of grieving is to celebrate his life,"" Swaynie says.</p> <p class="""">Like Swaynie, Lexi Gerken of Tennessee has cried multiple times since Perry's death. Unlike Swaynie, this year marks the first time the 21-year-old has dressed up as a pop culture character. ""No character has impacted me this much,"" she says. </p> <p class="""">The day after she heard of Perry’s death, she decided to make a costume, which was easy enough: ""I only had to buy sweatpants,"" she says. Her costume was taken from the scene the friends play football; Chandler wore a gray sweater and bluebaseball hat.</p> <p class=""""> Dressing up as Chandler has been ""cathartic"" for her, and a way to ""remind people of Matthew Perry and his great role."" She says she hopes the costume also reminds people of what Perry shared about his struggles.</p> <p class="""">While many ""Friends"" fans are donning slacks and sweaters in their quest be Chandler, some costumes pay homage to Chandler's own famous Halloween costume — specifically, his<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQYb_vH2Gc0"" target=""_blank""> reluctant transformation into a pink bunny</a>.</p> <p class="""">Melissa of Alberta, Canada, says her 11-year-old daughter — who loves ""Friends"" so much she painted her bedroom door purple —  started crying immediately after hearing the news. Her daughter had a brain surgery on her frontal lobe to mitigate seizures, which makes processing big emotions, like grief, more difficult. Melissa was ""shocked"" by the depth of her response: ""She usually can't deal with those emotions (because of) her surgery."" </p> <p class="""">At 4 p.m. Monday, the day before Halloween, she decided she wanted to be Chandler's bunny for Halloween — a change from her normal stance of never dressing up for the holiday. That afternoon, they drove to four stores before finding a costume that fit.</p> <p class="""">""She met up with her friends. They're like, 'Oh, you're a bunny.' She's like, 'No, I'm Chandler,"" she says.</p> <p class="""">Though her young friends aren't fans of the show, off they went trick-or-treating together.</p> <p class=""endmark"">""I feel like it's her way of processing through the emotional and depths, understanding that she's honoring him by being the bunny for Halloween,"" she says.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Elena Nicolaou is a senior entertainment editor at Today.com, where she covers the latest in TV, pop culture, movies and all things streaming.

From over-processing to environmental stressors and heat damage, the hair goes through a lot. This <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/caffeine-hair-growth-t288221?"" target=""_blank"">hair woe </a>might have led to vast frustrations and bad hair days, resulting in booking an expensive salon appointment to reverse the <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-damaged-hair-products-t255846?"" target=""_blank"">damage</a>. That is, until hair bonding treatments became available to the masses.</p> <p class="""">Previously, these products were gatekept by salons and those in the know, but more recently, you may have noticed more ""bond system"" collections pop up in the aisles of your local drug store or Ulta. So exactly what is a bonding product? And can it really fix your damaged hair? Thankfully, popular hair care brands have made hair bonding products more widely available, and we asked a hair stylist and trichologist to help break it all down for us. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://today.com/shop/best-hair-bonding-treatments-rcna122858#anchor-Whatisahairbondingproduct"" target=""_blank""><strong>What is a hair bonding product?</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://today.com/shop/best-hair-bonding-treatments-rcna122858#anchor-Whattypeofhairisbestforbondingproducts"" target=""_blank""><strong>What type of hair is best for bonding treatments?</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://today.com/shop/best-hair-bonding-treatments-rcna122858#anchor-Howdoyouusehairbondingproducts"" target=""_blank""><strong>How do you use hair bonding products?</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://today.com/shop/best-hair-bonding-treatments-rcna122858#anchor-Besthairbondingproductstoshop"" target=""_blank""><strong>Best products to shop</strong></a></p> <p class="""">Bonding treatments are a type of hair care product formulated to strengthen and repair broken disulfide bonds within the strands. Disulfide bonds give the hair strength and elasticity, which can be damaged by chemical processing and the use of heat tools, explains Anabel Kingsley, a consultant trichologist. This ultimately leads to that <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-products-dry-hair-t285072?"" target=""_blank"">dry</a>, dull and damaged feeling you might be experiencing. </p> <p class="""">The main bonding ingredient targets the center of the hair shaft, also known as the cortex, adds New Jersey-based hairstylist Michelle Cleveland. ""These types of products can penetrate the cortex and attach themselves to the broken bonds, effectively multiplying them, making the hair stronger,"" she says.</p> <p class="""">Whether it's <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/how-protect-hair-chlorine-damage-t289337?"" target=""_blank"">environmental</a> factors, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/how-protect-hair-chlorine-damage-t289337?"" target=""_blank"">coloring</a> or using heat, at some point, everyone's hair will be exposed to damage. That's why Kingsley says everyone and any <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-products-fine-hair-t253309"" target=""_blank"">type of hair</a> can benefit from using a bond-building product. ""However, those who do regularly chemically and mechanically process their hair will have more of a need to repair the bonds in their hair to help prevent split ends and breakage,"" Kingsley says. </p> <p class="""">Bond-builders come in a few different variations, including a pre-shampoo, shampoo and conditioner, or post-shower oil or cream. So how do you know where to start and should you be using the entire system?</p> <p class="""">Kingsley says a pre-shampoo treatment will work the best since it contains a higher level of active ingredients and is meant to be left on the hair for a longer period of time. Whereas a shampoo or conditioner system will be more diluted. However, Cleveland mentions that using the entire system and ""layering up"" is a good option, too!</p> <p class="""">""The star of the show is the patent bond multiplying ingredient, so as long as it’s in the product you’re using, you will see the benefits,"" says Cleveland. </p> <p class="""">For best results, Clevelands says she usually recommends using these products one to two times a week to her clients, depending on the damage, but notes that you'll want to follow the manufacturer's directions. She says most shampoo and conditioning systems are perfect for everyday use, but for specific bond multiplier products, you'll want to read the instructions and avoid jumping right in.</p> <p class="""">Now as you may have noticed, more and more brands are creating their own bond-building treatment systems, so we rounded up expert and editor-favorite options to shop, plus a few more affordable finds.</p> <p class="""">Cleveland says <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/people-are-loving-olaplex-hair-perfector-treatment-t174419?"" target=""_blank"">Olaplex</a> was one of the first brands to introduce bond multipliers and uses the brand's products on her clients. You'll find that they offer tons of different product types including shampoo and conditioner, oil and mask. </p> <p class="""">Shop TODAY editorial assistant Erica Marrison loves the pre-shampoo, which is the No. 3 Hair Protector in the bonding system. ""My hair is naturally curly and very fragile. After years of bleaching it to maintain cool-toned blonde strands, Olaplex’s Bond Maintenance line saved me! No. 3 is my favorite product — I definitely recommend leaving it in for the suggested 10 minutes (if not 20),"" she says.</p> <p class="""">The brand says the patented bond-building formula can be used every day and works to restore split ends and damaged hair to a healthier shine. For best results, use in tandem with the <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg118312"" href=""https://www.amazon.com/Olaplex-No-Bond-Maintenance-Conditioner/dp/B0BDBRK1B6?tag=hairbondingproductsrcna122858-20"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner</a>. </p> <p class="""">This repairing oil can be used on wet or dry hair, says the brand. One <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/olaplex-no-7-bonding-oil-t246725?"" target=""_blank"">Shop TODAY writer </a>says after using this product, her hair looks so sleek and smooth that it feels like she just had a professional keratin treatment. </p> <p class="""">The latest launch from Biolage is a new complete bonding system that consists of a pre-shampoo, shampoo, conditioner and leave-in treatment. According to the brand, the system is meant for medium to coarse hair to help build the hair bonds on over-processed and damaged hair. What sets this system apart from others is that it also has a product for those with finer and thinner hair: <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg123744"" href=""https://ulta.ztk5.net/15nWLa?subId1=hairbondingproductsrcna122858&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbond-therapy-conditioning-foam-pimprod2041085%3Fsku%3D2614381"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">Biolage Bond Therapy Conditioning Foam.</a></p> <p class="""">After trying out this new Biolage bonding system myself, I’ve completely fallen in love with the shampoo and conditioner; it’s really brought my dry and over-processed locks back to life. And not only does it smell <em>incredible</em>, but also my hair has never felt stronger and looked shinier  — without feeling heavy. </p> <p class="""">You don’t have to shell out a lot of money on bonding products, L'Oreal just entered the bond-building game with the launch of their own bonding repair system. This pre-shampoo treatment contains a potent bonding ingredient that's meant to be left on for up to 10 minutes, says the brand. Many reviewers say this product improved their hair texture when used alongside the shampoo and conditioner. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36BA12IS1L5B7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0BCGZLKKM"" target=""_blank"">One verified reviewer</a> says the L'Oreal bonding shampoo and conditioner also helped revive their hair after years of color damage. ""My hair texture is very fine, so moisturizing/bond repair products tend to weigh my hair down tremendously and make the roots look oily ... Though I’ve definitely discovered an answer to that conundrum is this shampoo/conditioner combo,"" wrote the Amazon reviewer.</p> <p class="""">Another affordable find is from the Bondbar line. Similar to other brands, they offer a variety of products that include a pre-shampoo, shampoo and conditioner and leave-in conditioner — for only $10 each. And SEO associate editor Kamari Stewart is a huge fan. </p> <p class="""">""It leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny every time I use it. My mom always asks what I have in my hair when I use it before a blowout. But I also love to use it when my hair is natural!"" says Stewart. She says she also uses (and loves) the <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg126922"" href=""https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9260995/type/dlg/sid/hairbondingproductsrcna122858/https://www.sallybeauty.com/brands/bondbar/bonding-leave-in-conditioner/SBS-016808.html"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">leave-in conditioner</a> and the <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg126922"" href=""https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9260995/type/dlg/sid/hairbondingproductsrcna122858/https://www.sallybeauty.com/brands/bondbar/bonding-curl-cream/SBS-016809.html"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">curl cream</a>.  </p> <p class="""">Another favorite of Stewart's is this shampoo and conditioner from Ouidad. ""It saved my hair after I put way too much protein in it and my hair was breaking/snapping easily,"" she says. ""It works really well on my 3B/3C <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/curly-girl-method-products-rcna100025?"" target=""_blank"">curls</a> but also works really well on my partner’s super tight 4C curls. The difference in breakage that went away within one wash was absolutely insane. I literally wish I took a before and after photo.""</p> <p class="""">If you're looking to ease into a bonding treatment, without having to apply then wait to wash out. This leave-in treatment is meant to be used and left on freshly cleaned hair. Not only will it help restore the hair's bonds, but will also act as a heat protectant, too. </p> <p class="""">Redken also offers a complete bonding system, which includes this shampoo and <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id="""" href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=96128X1550925&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Facidic-bonding-concentrate-conditioner-pimprod2022377&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fshop%2Fhairbondingproductsrcna122858"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">bonding conditioner</a>.  This repair system includes a pH-balancing formula, which the brand says can help bring your hair back to healthy pH levels while reinforcing the hair bonds.</p> <p class="""">According to the brand, this leave-in treatment contains a triple bond complex that will leave your hair feeling eight times stronger. For best results, the brand suggests applying this on clean, damp hair before styling — it even acts as a heat protectant to prevent further damage.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Shannon Garlin is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

'47 Brand offers affordable merch, whether it's a ballcap for $30, or tees that speak to their school's culture. </p> <p class="""">Between late nights at the library and early morning classes, comfy sweatpants are a college student’s best friend. You can’t ever go wrong with a Nike Fleece Jogger — it’s available in an assortment of chic colors and is machine-washable (perfect for the student who’s still mastering the art of laundry).</p> <p class="""">Nostalgic wear is <em>big </em>on college campuses right now. We're talking '90s movies Halloween costumes and <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/ugg-boots-trend-rcna121013"" target=""_blank"">Uggs </a>as soon as the autumn leaves hit the ground. Now, jelly sandals are having their moment, with search volume for ""adult jelly shoes,"" currently spiking according to Google Trends. This throwback style is made of 30% recycled factory waste and features a cushioned footbed for arch support, according to the brand.</p> <p class="""">With so little storage space in a college dorm room, multi-functional clothing is a necessity. This performance polo shirt is moisture-wicking so the college student you’re shopping for can wear it to class and to campus parties without worrying about sweat stains.</p> <p class="""">It’s all about the vintage shoes this year, proving yet again that a classic never goes out of style.</p> <p class="""">If you're planning to step foot in a lecture hall any time soon, expect to see more than a few pairs of Ugg slippers. While they have a hefty price tag, they're sure to last for years. Associate social editor Dani Musacchio previously voiced her love for the style. “I bought them in college and they’ve been going strong for over six years. They’re my go-to indoor/outdoor slippers.”</p> <p class="""">Much like sneakers and slides, Dr. Martens boots have become a mainstay on college campuses in recent years. The sturdy, stylish boots are fit for job interviews and seminar classes alike, making them a staple shoe for college students.</p> <p class="""">Would it be considered irony to look so cool in this jacket but be so warm at the same time? Your English or philosophy major should be able to give you the answer to this one.</p> <p class="""">Snacks are essential for late night study sessions. Unfortunately, those snacks also come with crumbs.

Brings car batteries back to life in moments and revives cellphones in a pinch.</p> <p class="""">The cafeteria is closed, Mom and Dad are miles away and your college kid needs to fend for themselves without burning the house down. While I can’t guarantee your college student won’t start a small kitchen fire, I can say this cookware will highly limit the chances of food getting stuck on the pan.</p> <p class="""">These sheets are so soft and comfortable, they legitimately qualify as an excuse for oversleeping and missing class.

Here is the ultimate ergonomic pivot! This laptop stand promotes good posture without cramping room space. Plus, it's compatible with all laptop sizes, according to the brand.</p> <p class="""">One drop, and their laptop is a goner.

The Apple AirTag helps your forgetful college student keep tabs on their keys, backpack, purse, wallet, you name it!

This keychain is fully <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-personalized-gifts-t199126"" target=""_blank"">customizable</a> — just add your desired picture, song and time duration.</p> <p class="""">Did your college student go to Hawaii for spring break?! Nope! Don’t panic, that’s just your college kid posing in front of their <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/sunset-projection-lamps-t211085"" target=""_blank"">sunset lamp</a>. Let your teen enjoy the relaxing sunset ambiance from the comfort of their own room.</p> <p class="""">Students on-the-go are going to need gadgets that multitask like they do. This air fryer can reheat leftovers, bake cookies, or crisp chicken nuggets while they complete other tasks. Now less than $25 at Target, this 2.6-quart air fryer also automatically shuts off after a certain amount of time to prevent overcooking. </p> <p class="""">Decorative and cozy, this is a great accent piece for any dorm room or college apartment.</p> <p class="""">Shop TODAY production coordinator and current college senior Bella Druckman is envious of her parents milk frother, prompting her to ask for one for the holidays. </p> <p class="""">""It was magical,"" she says. ""You just press a button and it froths your milk for you!""</p> <p class="""">Druckman is also asking for an Ember this Christmas, for continuously warm coffee while doing homework. </p> <p class="""">""I often do work in my room and sip slowly on my coffee and then it gets cold,"" she says, adding that ""this would solve all my problems.""

This isn’t just a record player; it’s a 7-in-1 musical experience. With this versatile player, your teen can rock out to Mom’s old vinyl collection, connect to the tunes of today via Bluetooth or just jam out old-school to FM radio. The coolest feature of this player? It can digitize vinyl records <em>and</em> CDs. Mind blown.</p> <p class="""">While gift cards may have the reputation of being a lazy gift, they are beloved by college students. We are eternally short on cash, so gift cards give us the power to treat ourselves to whatever we want. With Amazon selling everything from <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/student-approved-dorm-essentials-rcna100501"" target=""_blank"">college essentials</a> to <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/affordable-drugstore-beauty-must-haves-t247426"" target=""_blank"">beauty best sellers</a>, a gift card from the major retailer is a score. </p> <p class="""">Last Christmas, my aunt gave me a Starbucks gift card that I stretched throughout the entire spring semester. When I was having a bad day or simply needed a little extra caffeine to finish my homework, I’d head to Starbucks and treat myself to an oat milk mocha. I thought of my aunt each time I ordered my caffeinated treat and savored the gift card to the last cent. </p> <p class="""">I’m an English major, so I know firsthand that books can be expensive. That’s why a gift card to a bookstore can help the college student you’re shopping for succeed in their studies. This bookseller connects readers with independent booksellers and “every purchase on the site financially supports independent bookstores,” according to the brand.</p> <p class="""">If you’re not sure whether your giftee is eyeing <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-workout-leggings-pants-wellness-awards-rcna102220"" target=""_blank"">Align leggings</a> or an <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-workout-tops-wellness-awards-rcna101848"" target=""_blank"">Align tank</a>, they’ll likely appreciate a Lululemon gift card to make the choice themself. </p> <p class="""">Since Mom and Dad aren’t around to pick them up after a late night out with friends, an Uber gift card can supply a safe ride home. The gift card also applies to Uber Eats, so your kiddo can treat themselves to a tasty meal when the dining hall menu is less than appetizing. </p> <p class="""">Shopping for someone whose dorm room is covered in band posters? They’ll love a Live Nation gift card, so they can finally score tickets to see their favorite artist live. </p> <p class="""">Shop TODAY editors love these eye masks, and for good reason — they are <em>so </em>easy to use. After a long day of staring at a computer, your roommate will love tearing a warming eye mask out of its package for immediate warmth that eases eye strain.</p> <p class="""">If you and your roommate haven’t hopped on the LED light bandwagon, here’s your chance to do it for a great price — $13. The set comes with two 50-foot rolls of LED lights that you can control right from an app on your phone. </p> <p class="""">Is your roommate lacking in <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/21-best-home-gifts-home-decor-lover-your-life-t139746"" target=""_blank"">room decor</a>? Or do they love sitting in a pile of pillows? Either way, they’ll love this throw pillow adorned with heart-shaped flowers. </p> <p class="""">While it’s often prohibited to burn candles in college dorm rooms, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Scented-Candles-Top-Down-Adjustable-Brightness/dp/B09NQ4LN7F/?tag=238160giftguidecollegestudents-20"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">candle wax warmer lights</a> will allow you and your roommate to enjoy your favorite scents without the fire hazard. This wintery candle is commerce coordinator Alexa Arent’s favorite holiday scent. </p> <p class="""">Hoping to get closer to your roommate? This truth or dare card game includes 52 cards with prompts that you and your roommate will actually want to answer. During an hour-long car ride, I played this game with a group of NBCUniversal Pages and Interns and we couldn’t believe how much fun we had while genuinely learning more about each other. </p> <p class=""endmark"">“Lying under a heavy blanket can, indeed, be very soothing,” behavioral sleep psychologist Dr. Lynelle Schneeberg told Shop TODAY in a previous interview.

Dada’s take on the Italian staple uses nutritional yeast and cashews to create a luscious, umami-packed sauce.</p> <p class="""">Coconut milk is a traditional ingredient in many Thai-style curries — it gives them their signature creaminess without actual dairy cream. A variety of vegetables and firm tofu make this dish filling while keeping it light enough for a summer supper.</p> <p class="""">Hearty lentils and meaty mushroom take the place of animal protein in this rich chili. This healthy swap makes the dish so much better for you without leaving out any of the satisfying flavor or comforting texture from this cold weather classic.</p> <p class="""">“I came up with this Spicy and Crunchy Garlic Tofu recipe because it needed to happen,” says Molinaro about her TikTok-famous recipe. “Like, there was a gaping maw in the universe that could only be filled once this recipe was created.”</p> <p class="""">This salad made with hearty and nutritious wild rice can be enjoyed as a side dish or a main during lunch or dinner. It’s great served on its own or over a bed of leafy greens for extra bulk and fiber.</p> <p class="""">Chickpeas and other legumes are packed with fiber and plant-based protein and therefore deeply satisfying and healthy. In fact, their regular consumption is associated with enhanced health and longevity! The spices in this recipe are not just belly-warming and flavor-enhancing but also help the digestibility of the legumes, which can be challenging for some. This dish improves over time so make extras and freeze for a quick and delicious weeknight dinner.</p> <p class="""">The spicy coconut syrup in this dish transports you to the islands while the Romesco sauce is reminiscent of classic European cuisine. It’s a truly globally inspired dish that will keep you going back for more.</p> <p class="""">This beautiful Lebanese dish has been passed down from generations of women within Khoury’s family, nourishing them with nutrient rich lentils, vibrant seasonal vegetables and warm spices. You can make this dish in one large soup pot, enjoy it over several days for lunch or dinner and create large batches and freeze it for future family dinners to come. It is filled with layers of wholesome, bright and delicious flavors and is enjoyed best with a slice of warm toast, family and friends!</p> <p class="""">This vegan main by New York City-based vegan chef Chloe Coscarelli is hearty with a capital H! It’s kind of like a cross between tacos and mac and cheese — so definitely make it for your hungriest of friends and family members and just dare them to say vegan food isn’t filling.</p> <p class="""">You’re going to love this versatile rice medley. It’s perfect for a weeknight meal because everything is conveniently mixed together, dumped right onto a sheet pan and ready to eat in 30 minutes. Once you pull this pan from the oven, the onions will be caramelized, the raisins will be plump, the veggies will be tender and the room will fill with the smell of what Jerrelle Guy likes to call “sheet pan potpourri.”</p> <p class="""">This delicious sandwich is so easy to make and perfectly filling — for either lunch or dinner. “Even my toddler loves it!” says Claiborne.</p> <p class="""">This “chorizo” crafted by Beyoncé’s nutrition coach, Marco Borges, is created with umami-filled mushrooms. He usually makes an extra batch and stores it in the freezer to make more tacos later. It is, after all, a family favorite in the Borges house, too.</p> <p class="""">Summer in Taiwan is only bearable with this: a caramelly, sweet, custardy, cold sweet potato. That’s right: The sweet potatoes here are exactly as it sounds — baked then frozen. In Taiwan, these are so commonplace, you’ll find them packaged in plastic bags at convenience stores. But oddly enough, they are some of the best sweet potatoes you’ve ever had.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dadaeats/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"">Samah Dada’s</a> avocado cream sauce is both light and refreshing — qualities rarely found in creamy anything. This sauce also maintains an amazing brightness with the addition of fresh basil and lemon. You can add it over pasta or smother your favorite vegan protein in it.</p> <p class="""">This vegan-friendly pizza is a perfect weeknight fix and is quite the crowd-pleaser. It’s an easy base to add to, as well, in case you’re one of those <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/pineapple-acceptable-pizza-topping-america-decides-t118980"" target=""_blank"">people who eat pineapple on pizza </a>and want to see how it goes with veggie meatballs. And don’t get saucy, that’s cashew cheese … not real mozzarella!</p> <p class="""">Aloo gobi — potatoes and cauliflower sautéed in spices — was a staple of Priya Krishna’s upbringing. It’s simple to put together, pretty hands off, and its flavor to ease ratio is off the charts. Also, potatoes and cauliflower are truly exceptional at absorbing and enhancing seasonings.</p> <p class="""">Every bite of this meal is bursting with flavor — it has the perfect combination of sweetness and savoriness from the sweet potatoes, and sautéed black beans and kale. Plus, the cashew dressing adds lots of creaminess.</p> <p class="""">When you know that you have a recipe for a pantry-staple friendly, simple to prepare pasta in your back pocket, there are few things that can go wrong. This Lentil Bolognese is one of our favorites. It’s fun to use lentils in a Bolognese in the same way that you would meat, while keeping traditional elements like carrots and onions along for the ride. The result adds a plant-based twist to a traditional and iconic pasta dish.</p> <p class="""">These fries are our healthier version of the classic In-N-Out animal style fries. The usual ones are covered in cheese, mayo and onions, while this recipe is a vegan and healthier spin on the original. The fries get extra crispy in the oven (or you can air fry them!) and drizzled with the secret sauce on top with some caramelized onions and cashew cheese.</p> <p class="""">“I’ve always loved pepperoni pizza since I was a little kiddo and I have been itching to develop a simple plant-based pepperoni substitute for years!” says Gabrielle Reyes aka One Great Vegan. “The meaty mushrooms really soak in the full, robust flavor, and since it is hard to find a fierce plant-based and gluten-free bread these days, I am obsessed with these beautiful bagels.”</p> <p class="""">A stew so good they named it twice. This stew of black-eyed peas cooked in a gently spiced tomato sauce is a great vegan dish eaten all day long in Ghana — an alternative to baked beans for breakfast or as a bean casserole for lunch or dinner. Usually eaten with <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/kelewele-fried-spicy-plantains-recipe-t206015"" target=""_blank"">fried plantains</a>, this is tasty, nourishing comfort food that’s super easy to make.</p> <p class="""">“Like the cuisine of many cultures, Korean dishes are designed to make use of every scrap of food before it goes bad,” says Molinaro. “Kimchi fried rice is, like bibimbap, a ‘recipe’ that was born of need, when grocery stores weren’t around every corner and folks had to make do with whatever they had in the refrigerator. Well, I have never seen a Korean kitchen without kimchi or rice!”</p> <p class="""">“These are sweet enough to make you remember what a mess you’d make with the icing from a cinnamon roll as a little kid,” Clairborne says about her vegan rolls. “They’re also delicious enough to put your ‘healthy diet’ rules on suspension for a few minutes, and then reject any bit of regret.”</p> <p class="""">Classic Italian pesto gets a healthy makeover with a big serving of spinach. This recipe is customizable and tastes great with blistered tomatoes, almond milk ricotta, more olive oil and something crunchy like walnuts or pine nuts. Using chick pea pasta will also add a little extra protein to the dish.</p> <p class="""">What’s a Meatless Monday without a solid burger substitute sitting at the table? Sunny Anderson’s black bean burgers are so hearty and satisfying, it’s easy to forget they’re not made out of beef. Oatmeal helps bind the burger and also adds bulk to the patties. Bean appétit!</p> <p class="""">“<a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-chickpea-blondies-t126993"" target=""_blank"">Chickpea blondies</a> are one of my all-time most popular recipes, so a chickpea brownie seemed like the next obvious choice,” says Dada. “This brownies are fudgy and super easy to make because the batter comes together in a blender.”</p> <p class="""">We love this recipe because it’s so flavorful and hearty. This is a home run for people who are worried about walking away from the table unsatisfied. It’s great for large groups and serves up well, year-round.</p> <p class="""">“I will never forget how my father waited patiently on the living room sofa as my mother frantically fried dozens and dozens of egg rolls for his work holiday party,” says Molinaro. “It was around midnight because my dad worked the night shift. It was the one time of the year that my father, who was probably the most introverted and socially awkward employee at the United States Postal Service, became the most popular man at the office. The holiday party wasn’t complete without my mom’s egg rolls. I’ve used my mother’s egg rolls to win over grumpy teachers and colleagues alike, and even my own mother-in-law declared them to be worthy of attempted bribery.”</p> <p class="""">Love a bowl of comforting mac but also want to get your greens? This dish has got you covered. Simple, creamy and craveable, it’s 100% plant-based so it’s good for you <em>and</em> the earth.</p> <p class="""">When a craving for something like popcorn chicken strikes, instead of opting for takeout, whip up a quick batch of these vegetarian-friendly poppers made with cauliflower. Dredged in egg, breaded in gluten-free almond meal and tossed in warm, flavorful spices, these bite-sized florets are irresistible when they come sizzling out of the oven.</p> <p class=""endmark"">“I remember I made these and I left them sitting on the counter. My son, who is averse to trying new things, started eating them — many of them,” says Jessica Seinfeld. “That’s the ultimate sign of success in our house: Eating something with no raised eyebrows or complaints.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Erica Chayes Wida is an award-winning journalist, food writer and recipe editor who helmed a local newspaper before joining TODAY's freelance team.

Or you get up to grab an item from another room and can’t remember what it was once you get there.</p> <p class="""">Is it the start of memory troubles? Could <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/will-i-get-alzheimer-s-disease-neurologist-answers-common-questions-t137975"" target=""_blank"">Alzheimer’s disease</a> be looming in the future?</p> <p class="""">Memory does naturally start to decline earlier than we think — when people are in their 30s — but such incidents are common and illustrate perfectly normal forgetting, said Dr. Richard Restak, a clinical professor of neurology and rehabilitation medicine at the GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences.</p> <p class="""">“These are things that people needlessly worry about,” Restak, author of the book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1510770275?tag=nb013-book-20"" target=""_blank"">“The Complete Guide to Memory: The Science of Strengthening Your Mind</a>,” told TODAY. </p> <p class="""">In the case of the person unable to remember why they came into a room, “it sounds like a serious matter, but most of the time the person is preoccupied with something,” he noted. Blanking over the parking space happens when we rush to get to work or the mall, don’t pay attention to the location of the spot and fail to form a memory.</p> <p class="""">Now if you don’t remember <em>how</em> you got to the mall — whether by car or bus — that’s a sign of a memory that needs further investigation, Restak warned.</p> <p class="""">But forgetting often happens simply because we’re not focusing. Paying attention to something long enough to really observe it is key to memory, but that’s being threatened by all the rush of modern society, he said.</p> <p class="""">“You’ve got to make efforts to set up your memory and keep it working,” he noted. “You want to enhance whatever natural abilities you might have.”</p> <p class="""">Here are his tips for keeping memory sharp at any age:</p> <p class="""">Both activities employ the use of working memory — which involves maintaining a particular piece of information and moving it around your head, ""so it doesn’t just sit there,"" Restak said.</p> <p class="""">Nonfiction books don’t quite do the job: You can jump back and forth and read only the information that interests you, if you wanted to.</p> <p class="""">“You can’t do that in a work of fiction. You have to go from beginning to end. But most importantly, you have to remember the characters. You have to remember something about them,” Restak noted. “It’s really much more challenging in terms of the brain.”</p> <p class="""">Following cookbook recipes is a similar concept. There are steps to keep track of and various bowls or pots to coordinate. Once you master the instructions, your working memory allows you make variations or take shortcuts.</p> <p class="""">Poker, bridge and chess can be helpful. Restak also liked crossword puzzles and Sudoku, but he was a fan of the game 20 Questions in particular.</p> <p class="""">All of these games also give your working memory a workout. “Working memory is associated with intelligence, therefore it’s a part of your mind that you want to maintain the best way you can, and it can be done in very informal ways,” Restak said.</p> <p class="""">He advised regularly doing mental exercises like naming U.S. presidents from President Joe Biden to as far back in time as you can remember. Once you have that list in your head, then name only Democrats or Republicans. Then name all the presidents in alphabetical order. Those rearrangements let your working memory shine because you’ve got to keep in mind everything that you placed there before.</p> <p class="""">Restak recommended doing working memory exercises every day.</p> <p class="""">We have to learn how to write and read, but we don’t have to learn how to see things, Restak pointed out.</p> <p class="""">Seeing is “more primal” than writing and reading, “so therefore if we could convert language into images, it will definitely enhance your memory. You’ll remember much easier,” he advised.</p> <p class="""">That’s the classic tip for remembering names. Restak recalled meeting someone named Dr. King and picturing him with a white coat, stethoscope and a crown on his head. It’s not always that easy, so you have to think about: What does that name sound like? Look like? </p> <p class="""">""Get in the habit of converting anything which you find hard to remember into a wild, bizarre or otherwise attention-grabbing image,"" Restak advised in his book.</p> <p class="""">These issues are shown to be directly related to the onset of dementia, most notably Alzheimer’s, Restak said.</p> <p class="""">“It’s hard to remember something that you haven’t seen clearly,” he noted. “(But) I think the hearing is even more important in some ways.”</p> <p class="""">Poor hearing is among 12 modifiable risk factors for dementia, according to a 2020 commission report in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">The Lancet</a>. </p> <p class="""">It can change the context of a conversation and prevent people from keeping up in social situations, so it pays to protect your hearing in your younger years and use hearing aids when they become necessary.</p> <p class="""">Naps help consolidate memories, so if you’re studying or preparing for a presentation, take a sleep break afterwards — it can help you recall that information, Restak said.</p> <p class="""">His preferred nap length is 20 minutes. A daily nap can be helpful if it fits into your schedule — the afternoon can be the best time as people naturally become drowsy after lunch.</p> <p class="""">Alcohol is a weak neurotoxin — “killer of brain cells,” as Restak puts it in his book. If a person starts drinking in their early 20s, their brain will have decades of exposure to it by the time they become an older adult.</p> <p class="""">Excessive alcohol consumption is another modifiable risk factor for dementia, according to <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">The Lancet report</a>.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Restak advises his patients to stop drinking alcohol altogether by age 70 at the latest, “when it’s necessary to conserve as many neurons as possible,” he writes in his book.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">A.

But how are you spending them? If your New Year’s Eve plans are dinner and a night in, then you might have to have a movie ready.</p> <p class="""">It’s only a matter of <em>which </em>movie you want to ring in the new year with. Chances are, you’re over <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/best-christmas-movies-rcna48412"" target=""_blank"">Christmas movies</a> and are ready for something different. </p> <p class="""">People seeking a <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/best-family-movies-rcna26928"" target=""_blank"">family-friendly option</a> might go for Disney’s contemplative “Soul” or the comedy “Are We There Yet.” For a more timely movie, find one set <em>on </em>New Year’s Eve, like Nora Ephron's famous flick ""When Harry Met Sally.""</p> <p class="""">Whether you want to match up a movie for when the clock strikes midnight, or just need some inspiration to head into the new year, here are 30 of the best movies to watch on New Year’s Eve on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Beyond.</p> <p class="""">While the Charlie Brown Christmas, Halloween and Thanksgiving specials are more well known, “Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!” is an underrated film to watch with the whole family.</p> <p class="""">Nick (Ice Cube) wants to get closer with Suzanne (Nia Long), so he takes her two kids on a trip from Portland to Vancouver on New Year’s Eve to go see her. But the trip becomes much more difficult than Nick thought, and the kids are mostly to blame.</p> <p class="""">Let’s hope 2024 doesn’t look anything like “Snowpiercer,” but it can still be a great watch for anybody looking to end off the year with an action-packed thriller from the mind of Bong Joon-ho. When the world falls into an apocalyptic ice age, the last remaining humans live on a forever moving train separated by class. As Curtis (Chris Evans) starts an uprising, New Year’s becomes a central aspect to the film.</p> <p class="""">Mrs. Flax (Cher) and her two daughters, Charlotte (Winona Ryder) and Kate (Christina Ricci), are constantly on the move. But the kids have enough when they move to a small town in Massachusetts, especially after Charlotte meets Joe (Michael Schoeffling). Family drama ensues at a New Year’s Eve party.</p> <p class="""">Illusionists, heists and a stacked cast — “Now You See Me 2” is a follow-up to an ensemble heist movie with card tricks instead of fast cars. The sequel ends on New Year’s Eve in a finale that’s worth staying up past midnight for.</p> <p class="""">Four friends reunite at a New Year’s Eve party for a game of “Never Have I Ever.” But as old secrets are revealed, the night quickly goes from nostalgic to violent. For those looking to end the year on a more frightening note, “Into The Dark: New Year, New You” scratches that itch and offers a good excuse as to why you don’t <em>actually</em> want to go to New Year’s Eve parties.</p> <p class="""">It's <em>nearly </em>impossible not to love this rom com classic, thanks to its eminently quotable writing Nora Ephron and performances from Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan. Their lovably idiosyncratic characters, Harry and Sally, go on a 12-year journey, transforming from strangers, enemies to unexpected friends, slowly realizing they might be perfect for each other along the way. The movie includes an iconic New Year’s scene and for the sake of not giving away any spoilers, we’ll just say it’ll make you wonder where your own Harry or Sally is. </p> <p class="""">Blake Lively’s character Adaline in ""The Age of Adaline"" challenges the phrase ""you only live once"" by instead living ... forever. The immortal character attends fabulous New Year’s Eve parties throughout different eras (how else do you mark the fact that you're not growing older as the rest of the world is?). During one such occasion, she meets a dashing Ellis Jones played by Michiel Huisman, who she soon falls in love with. Adaline must face the challenges this new love poses as time ticks on for everyone but her.</p> <p class="""">Say ""High School Musical,"" and a group of teenagers who have songs and dance moves for every life situation will probably come to mind. If you grew up with a franchise, you may still get butterflies from the moment Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens' characters Troy and Gabriella hit it off for the first time at a New Year’s Eve party. This scene alone will either make you or your teen at home break out into dance moves as you sing along to ""Start of Something New.""</p> <p class="""">Follow the intertwining story of different New Yorkers as they navigate love, happiness, second chances and new beginnings on New Year’s Eve. The star packed film, which includes Leah Michelle, Zac Efron and Ashton Kutcher, is certain to have a storyline for whatever mood you are chasing in 2023. </p> <p class="""">If there is someone <a href=""https://collider.com/the-godfather-part-2-fredo-kiss-repercussions/"" target=""_blank"">you don’t want to kiss on New Year’s</a>, it’s Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), also known as the Godfather. However, if you are looking for a night packed with crime, suspense and a celebratory atmosphere, the Corleone family is who you will want to spend it with. The crime drama features a New Year’s Eve party in Havana, Cuba, where Corleone comes to heartbreaking realizations concerning members of his most trusted circle. </p> <p class="""">Who better to celebrate another year of the roaring twenties than with Gatsby himself? The extravaganza of Jay Gatsby’s (Leonardo DiCaprio) parties in ""The Great Gatsby,"" along with his love story with Daisy (Carey Mulligan), will set the mood for a night surrounded by your own “old sports” and glasses of champagne. </p> <p class="""">""While You Were Sleeping"" has an unusual meet-cute. It all starts at a Chicago train station when Lucy (Sandra Bullock) saves the life of Peter (Peter Gallagher), a passenger she's long harbored a crush on. He ends up in a coma and — due to an error at the hospital — Lucy is identified as his fiancée. At the news of this, Peter's family, including his brother (Bill Pullman), welcomes her into their circle. The film takes place during the holiday season, including a New Year’s Eve scene.</p> <p class="""">Whether it’s closing chapters or starting new ones, New Year’s is the perfect time to reflect back at the past and look toward the future. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" does just that, as Will Smith acts out the life of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman in pursuit of a life-changing career for him and his son (played by Smith's actual son Jaden Smith). The biographical drama will inspire you to chase happiness this new year and fill you with determination to face all the challenges that come with dreaming big.  </p> <p class="""">If you could relive an era in your life, which would it be and what would you change? Domhnall Gleeson’s character Tim knows his answer in ""About Time,"" as he travels back to a New Year’s party and kisses the girl of his dreams, played by Rachel McAdams, soon after discovering he has inherited his family’s ability to time travel. The film will make you root for love and its never-ending awkwardness.</p> <p class="""">How would you define the feeling that sets in your stomach seconds before the New Year’s ball is about to drop? Maybe it’s like feeling everything everywhere all at once. ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is <em>not </em>a New Year's movie, but it touches on the feeling of infinite possibilities that the holiday often is associated with. Travel through alternate universes with Michelle Yeoh as her character is swept up in an adventure where she alone can save the world while exploring all the lives she could have led. The film will make you get deep about parenthood, empathy, and untrodden paths ... and make wonder who you would really like to ""just do laundry and taxes with.""</p> <p class="""">Whether you’re a Philadelphia Eagles fan or Jennifer Lawrence fan, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is another film set to help you welcome the new year. Co-starring Bradley Cooper, the movie touches on themes like new beginnings and navigating romantic relationships when you're not quite done healing.</p> <p class="""">Run to the new year with Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, a character who manages to intersect with history, over and over again, simply through lucky timing and sheer openness. The movie might have you thinking about courage, character and taking life for what it is (oh, and chocolate). The movie also includes a New Year’s party with Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), which, like most New Year’s Eve parties, takes an unexpected direction. </p> <p class="""">Glamour and champagne make for a good New Year’s Eve on screen, but if you are looking for a more realistic version of the night, :Bridget Jones’s Diary"" is the film you’ll want to watch. The film opens on New Year’s Day, with a single Bridget (Renée Zellweger) spending the day with her family, watching reruns of ""Frasier"" and listening to ""All By Myself."" Jones decides to start the year with resolutions that include losing weight, finding a nice boyfriend and doing the week’s laundry of course. </p> <p class="""">Perhaps a lesson learned as the year wraps up is that ""tomorrow is another day"" — except if you’re Bill Murray’s character on ""Groundhog Day."" Phil, a cynical weatherman, finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. His predicament drives him to turn the situation into his advantage and soon after desperation, as he falls in love with his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell). This next year doesn't have to be a ""Groundhog Day"" of the one that came before it. </p> <p class="""">Have a grand time on New Year’s Eve by watching Hallmark’s ""Royal New Year’s Eve."" The story follows Caitlyn, an aspiring fashion designer who falls in love with her socialite client’s perspective fiancé, Prince Jeffrey, who is expected to propose at the New Year’s Ball. All <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/how-to-watch-hallmark-christmas-movies-rcna53695"" target=""_blank"">Hallmark movies are now streaming on Peacock</a>. </p> <p class="""">Check off this comedy drama from your own bucket list on New Year’s Eve. The story follows Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman), two terminally ill strangers with a mission in common: They want to check off a few last musts before they die. The movie will have you reaching for your own pen and paper on New Year’s Eve and perhaps throughout the year. </p> <p class="""">An adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel ""The Price of Salt,"" ""Carol"" follows the unexpected love affair between Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young department store worker, and elegant housewife Carol (Cate Blanchett) in the 1950s, with their first kiss happening on New Year’s. </p> <p class="""">New Year’s is the perfect time for resolutions, new beginnings and according to Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra), casino heists. Follow Ocean and his 11 pals through an elaborate New Year’s Eve heist as they bet their future in Las Vegas. Even if you're already familiar with the 2001 version starring George Clooney, the holiday-set classic starring the much of the Rat Pack is worth a watch.</p> <p class="""">We, too, would go to the top of the Empire State building and look for Tom Hanks, just like Meg Ryan’s character does in ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Annie surprises herself by falling in love with Sam, a widowed father whose son tries to find him a partner by calling a radio-talk show. The movie will set the mood for New Year’s by also including a reference to the holiday.<strong> </strong></p> <p class="""">This family-friendly film will help you embrace any blue emotions you might be feeling as you say goodbye to 2022 and hello to 2023. Taking place in the mind of a middle schooler, ""Inside Out"" shows how our emotions can often take the reins. They <em>say </em>it's for kids — but ""Inside Out"" is bound to make the adults in the room cry more.</p> <p class="""">Love, elegant dresses and a New Year’s Eve party is what you can expect from this Oscar-winning film starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps. Dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock is living in the British fashion world in the 1950s — dressing royalty, movie stars, heiresses, socialites and debutantes. His carefully tailored bachelor existence soon gets disrupted by Alma, a strong-willed woman who becomes his muse and lover.</p> <p class="""">Ferris Bueller’s (Matthew Broderick) skipping school. His big day off consists of stolen Ferraris and Chicago filled adventures as he realizes his high school days are coming to an end. The film will make you want to make every moment count this new year, even the sick days. </p> <p class="""">Who are you calling on New Year’s? If you’re spending the night with a group of all ages, we recommend you call on the Ghostbusters. The sequel features an action packed slimy New Year’s Eve celebration that will make you slip your way into 2023.<strong> </strong></p> <p class=""endmark"">No New Year's resolutions? The animated film ""Soul"" teaches people this is perfectly fine. After landing the gig of a lifetime, New York jazz pianist Joe Gardner (voiced by Jamie Foxx), suddenly finds himself trapped in a strange land between Earth and the afterlife. Joe soon learns there is something freeing about walking out of the door and enjoying life without needing to prove anything. </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Anahy Diaz is a Platforms NBC Page at <a href=""http://today.com/"" target=""_blank"" data-stringify-link=""http://TODAY.com"" data-sk=""tooltip_parent"" data-remove-tab-index=""true"">TODAY.com</a>, where she contributes to the management of newsletters and main cover stories.

In this column, I address some of the most common questions and roadblocks that trip people up on their journey to establish a health and fitness routine. </em></p> <p class="""">First of all, there are so many factors that contribute to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/weight-loss-tips-doctor-lost-100-pounds-rcna64018"" target=""_blank"">weight loss</a> — and gain! — that there's no reason to think that you're doing anything wrong, per se. It is totally normal to feel frustrated or worried, though. You are not alone. We all want to see results. </p> <p class="""">So many of my clients become discouraged when they don’t see the scale start to move after committing to a workout plan. I’ve seen some people in our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1946437762286924"" target=""_blank"">Start TODAY Facebook community</a> feeling down about not <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/my-weight-loss-journey"" target=""_blank"">seeing weight-loss results</a> even though they’ve been fully committed to our monthly workout plans.</p> <p class="""">Those feelings of frustration can lead some people to give up entirely — or to abandon one approach for another without giving the first one enough time to ""work."" That's why it is so crucial to keep the numbers on the scale in perspective and to understand all the factors that go into weight loss. </p> <p class="""">It’s important to remember that <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-lose-weight-doctor-shares-6-essential-tips-make-it-t218996"" target=""_blank"">weight loss</a> can take time — and you are more likely to maintain weight loss if it is accomplished in a slow, steady way. That being said, seeing the scale tick down slowly  takes patience. Luckily, it is far from the only sign that your exercise routine is working! </p> <p class="""">I try to encourage people to look for <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/5-signs-your-fitness-routine-working-today-t212003"" target=""_blank"">“non-scale victories”</a> to measure progress, rather than focusing on the number on the scale. Some of these things include: feeling more energized, sleeping better, your clothes fitting better, a better mood, feeling less stressed and feeling more motivated to workout.</p> <p class="""">It’s also important to note that while exercising is beneficial for weight loss, it’s only one lifestyle factor that contributes to your ability to lose weight. In other words, losing weight usually requires more than just movement — so your fitness routine may or may not have anything to do with the number on the scale. </p> <p class="""">If your diet, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/sleep-better-today"" target=""_blank"">sleep</a> and stress levels are out of whack, these can contribute to the scale not budging. I teamed up with <a href=""https://www.today.com/author/kristin-kirkpatrick-tdpn108977"" target=""_blank"">Kristin Kirkpatrick</a>, a nutritionist and contributor to TODAY.com, to help you figure out what may be holding your weight loss back. </p> <p class="""">Look at your routine and see if one of these things may be hindering your progress:</p> <p class="""">If you're working out on a regular basis but not pushing yourself enough, that may prevent you from seeing the results you want. My general advice is that for every <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/20-minute-full-body-workout-barry-s-bootcamp-t217126"" target=""_blank"">20-minute workout</a>, you should strive to hit your maximum effort at least three times. </p> <p class="""">How can you tell if you're getting there? With cardio, it feels like needing to catch your breath and your heart is really pumping. For strength training, you can feel your muscles burning and becoming exhausted with the movements and weight.</p> <p class="""">Also, if you're only doing the same kind of workout over and over, you may be less likely to see your body change. That's because your body gets used to doing the same kind of exercise and it gets easier. So if you mostly do cardio, try adding strength-training and vice versa. You can also try a class that has a variety of types of exercise within it, like <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pilates-exercises-rcna26346"" target=""_blank"">Pilates</a> or <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/workout-plan-aerobics-workout-at-home-rcna126672"" target=""_blank"">aerobics</a>.</p> <p class="""">On the other hand, working yourself too hard when you're exercising can prevent you from losing weight for a variety of reasons. For example, you may end up eating more and moving less when you're not exercising, and it can affect the way your body burns fat. That's why it's important to have recovery or rest days, where you do less intense activities.</p> <p class="""">But if you prefer to keep up the intensity, just try adding some <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-low-impact-exercise-fitness-test-rcna18170"" target=""_blank"">low-impact exercises</a> into your routine to move your body in a different way, which can help with weight loss. Starting Pilates led to major changes in my body!</p> <p class="""">If you're not getting enough sleep at night — seven to eight hours for most adults — then that can harm a lot of your health goals, weight loss included. Sleep is especially important as you age, and not getting enough of it can lead <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ejcn2016201a.html"" target=""_blank"">overeating</a>, research shows. Another way <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/sleep-weight-loss-rcna16287"" target=""_blank"">sleep affects weight loss</a> is that it's is necessary for the body to perform basic functions, including those that help you lose weight.</p> <p class="""">In fact, sleep is so important for your health that if a client asks me to choose between exercising and getting adequate sleep, I say sleep!</p> <p class="""">Not eating the right foods means you won't lose that much weight even if you're working out, as <a href=""https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-which-is-better-for-losing-weight-diet-or-exercise/"" target=""_blank"">research has shown</a> that diet has a greater impact on weight loss than exercise. So, if you're not adding enough fruits, vegetables and healthy protein to your plate, you may find yourself opting for quick <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/what-is-ultraprocessed-food-rcna46033"" target=""_blank"">ultra-processed foods</a> or items with <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/what-are-added-sugars-rcna78561"" target=""_blank"">added sugar</a>.</p> <p class="""">Getting protein into your system several times a day helps with blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings and improve your metabolism. There are plenty of <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-protein-low-carb-foods-rcna30111"" target=""_blank"">high-protein, low-carb foods</a>, too.</p> <p class="""">If your diet needs an overhaul, consider starting by upping your intake of greens and healthy fats, like nuts, seeds and olive oil.</p> <p class="""">Research shows that being stressed can prevent weight loss in many people because cortisol, the stress hormone, may lead the body to preserve weight, primarily around your belly. What's more, high levels of stress can exhaust your nervous system and prevent your body from doing basic functions, like digesting food and burning fat.</p> <p class="""">Prioritizing learning <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-deal-stress-daily-basis-t126882"" target=""_blank"">stress-reduction habits</a> can have positive effects on your health far beyond weight loss. (Too much stress is associated with heart disease, depression, anxiety, gastrointestinal issues, muscle pain, trouble sleeping and more.)</p> <p class="""">Therapy, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/moving-meditations-yoga-breathing-racing-thoughts-rcna82304"" target=""_blank"">meditation</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/4-yoga-breathing-exercises-help-reduce-anxiety-today-t231145"" target=""_blank"">breathing exercises</a> and exercise can all help reduce cortisol levels and get you back on track with weight loss.</p> <p class="""">Not losing weight despite eating and exercising right, getting enough sleep and keeping stress at bay could be a sign that something is wrong medically.</p> <p class="""">That's why it's important to involve your doctor in your weight loss journey and get checkups regularly. Ask your primary health care provider if you're taking any medications that could prevent weight loss. And be sure to get bloodwork done every year. If your vitamin B and D levels or your thyroid levels are abnormal, then that could play a role in not losing weight. Or you may have another deficiency that could lead your body to hang on to weight.</p> <p class="""">Haven't been to the doctor in a while? Schedule an appointment ASAP!</p> <p class="""">I encourage my weight loss clients to view water as a weight loss elixir! Think of your body like a sponge — if it’s dried up and shriveled on the side of the sink, you can’t wring any soap or dirt out of it. But when it’s full of water and moist, you can. You want your body to have enough water to get rid of any toxins. </p> <p class="""">When your body wonders when it’s going to get fed, it may hold on to nutrients and not burn them because it’s afraid it’s going to starve. By feeding your body frequently and with the right type of nutrients, your body can get into a rhythm and won’t hold on to excess fat for fear of not getting enough fuel.</p> <p class="""">Of course, if you are overeating or <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/rebel-wilson-talks-about-how-she-broke-free-emotional-eating-t198482"" target=""_blank"">emotional eating</a>, this too can lead to weight loss resistance. ""We often eat because we are bored, stressed, tired, thirsty or simply because our favorite show is on,"" said Kirkpatrick, who believes food should be viewed as fuel, not entertainment.</p> <p class="""">""I advise my patients to put themselves on a hunger scale with 1 being starving and 10 being stuffed. Only at a 3 or a 4 should they eat, and they should stop at 5 or 6. Listening to your hunger isn’t always easy, but master it and your chances of weight loss go up,"" she said. </p> <p class="""">Sure, maybe you get in a 45 minute daily workout, but then if you sit for four to eight hours straight, the metabolism can slow down, circulation can decrease, and your calorie burn is slim to none. Add in a 5 minute movement break every 1 hour you’re sitting down.</p> <p class="""">Yes, alcohol can help you fall asleep, but it wreaks havoc on your body’s ability to stay asleep, thus impeding those much-needed hours of resting and digesting.</p> <p class="""">You don't have to become a teetotaler! Just limit your intake and make sure you're not drinking any alcohol for at least an hour before you try to go to sleep.</p> <p class="""">When your circadian rhythm is off, so are your body’s functions —including those that help with weight loss. Even if you get enough sleep, if there's no rhyme or reason to when you sleep, it could impact your body's ability to burn calories efficiently. </p> <p class="""">When your blood sugar levels dip and aren’t stable throughout the day, your body’s ability to lose weight is impeded. Routine helps optimize all our bodily functions, including how we use energy — aka burn calories. Being on a blood sugar rollercoaster is stressful for your body. If it can't get used to when it will get more energy — calories — it may try to conserve them. That's natural, but it can be frustrating if you're trying to lose weight. </p> <p class="""">""Calories from refined carbohydrates and sugar cause you to eat more, without feeling satisfied,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""Calories from healthy fats, fiber rich sources and protein, however, are metabolized differently and more likely to lead to effective weight loss,"" Kirkpatrick added. </p> <p class="""">In case you're wondering what counts as real food, author Michael Pollen defined “food” as “something that comes from nature, was fed from nature and will eventually rot,"" said Kirkpatrick. So be careful of how many packaged and processed foods you're eating. They may be less real than you think.</p> <p class="""">""Cereal, toast with jam, or a big glass of OJ are breakfast staples, but studies show that starting the day with protein, instead of sugary carbohydrates leads to reduced <a href=""http://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-13-97"">hunger and cravings</a> later in the day,"" says Kirkpatrick. She recommends that you aim for at least 15 grams of high quality protein in the morning — such as plain yogurt with mixed nuts and hempseed, a plant based protein shake, scrambled eggs, or nut butter on sprouted bread.</p> <p class="""">The people who care about you probably want you to be healthy and happy, but if they don't have healthy habits themselves, it may be hard for them to support you. Kirkpatrick recounted one <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2016.1278497"">study</a>  that found that individuals who had successfully lost weight were frequently met with challenges with friends, family and co-workers. In response, they would regain the weight.</p> <p class="""">That doesn't mean your loved ones don't care about you! It's just difficult to be supportive if you don't understand the changes that someone you care about is trying to make. If you come across this problem with your loved ones, try having a serious heart-to-heart with them about why you want to lose weight and how they can help you.</p> <p class=""endmark"">It's a lot easier to support the lifestyle changes of those you care about if you know why they're making them and what you can do to help!</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Stephanie Mansour is a contributing health and fitness writer for TODAY.

No matter how it starts — whether it’s after a crazy bachelor vacation or from a few slices of cake, the on-screen chemistry, comedic wingmen/women and tough to please in-laws are the recipes to the perfect romantic flick. If you’re looking to cheer on the hopeless romantic or throw your box of chocolates at the screen, Amazon Prime has something for everyone. </p> <p class="""">Here are 20 romance movies we think you’ll love.</p> <p class="""">With just one week away from his wedding, Paul’s (Jason Lee) goal is to maintain his clean slate even during his wild bachelor party. When he wakes up with the bartender (Julia Stiles) and can’t remember the night before, he starts telling lies to cover his tracks and keep his fiancé (Selma Blair) from finding out what may have happened.</p> <p class="""">Drew Barrymore stars as Lauren, a divorced mom of two boys who agrees to be set up on a blind date with a widowed dad of three girls, Jim (Adam Sandler).

That is until an unlikely trip to a South African resort forces them to vacation together and they realize how much they needed each other all along.</p> <p class="""">Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) is a frugal NYU professor excited to visit Asia for the first time as her boyfriend’s (Henry Golding) wedding date.

In the fight to win over his family, she learns who really pays the price when choosing love over family.</p> <p class="""">Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) thought his life was nothing short of perfect — until his wife (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce after admitting she had an affair. Single, friendless and underdressed, Cal realizes there’s more to the dating pool than just showing up to a bar. Cue Ryan Gosling’s character, Jacob, who notices Cal and takes him under his wing to teach him how to win over the ladies and in turn make his ex-wife jealous. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is filled with twists and knock out turns that proves it’s never too late to find love.</p> <p class="""">Sue and Al (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw) are ready to be empty nesters. The only problem is, their 35-year-old son Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) has no reason to leave — he can invite girls over, his mom does his laundry and he’s free to play video games with his friends (who also live at home) whenever he wants. After hiring “professional motivator” Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker) to push their son out of their house, she soon finds that she’s met her match. </p> <p class="""">""Fools Rush In"" is the tale of when what happens in Vegas doesn’t stay in Vegas.

Meanwhile, ad exec Ben (Matthew McConaughey) bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him within the same timeframe. When the two meet, their plans take an unexpected turn.</p> <p class="""">For many, divorce can be complicated especially with kids involved.

After one drink leads to another, Jane and Jake wound up in what lead them to divorce in the first place: an affair.

Symbolized by the archer, the Sagittarius vibe is passionate but adaptable, rebellious but optimistic and restless but committed to expansion and learning. In Western astrology, people with a Sagittarius sun sign are born between Nov. 22 and Dec. 21. </p> <p class="""">They tend to be party people, but they’re also the most idealistic and humanitarian of the <a href=""https://www.today.com/life/astrology/fire-signs-rcna105108"" target=""_blank"">fire signs</a>. The stereotype is that they’re the biggest travelers of the zodiac, but even the rare homebody Sagittarians love to experience adventure in their own ways. </p> <p class="""">When out of balance, Sagittarius energy can be a bit of a chaotic mess — disorganized, commitment-phobic, inconsistent, reckless, self-sabotaging, overly blunt, impulsive and/or tactless. </p> <p class="""">In addition to fun gifts, they benefit from <strong>useful and practical items that help them to keep themselves together</strong> without trying to change who they are.</p> <p class="""">Sagittarius can be delightfully unpredictable, so we’re here to help you choose gifts for them that they’ll really love and actually use.</p> <p class="""">Whether your Sagittarius is a <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-travelers-t197388"" target=""_blank"">frequent flyer</a> or just spends a lot of nights away from home, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-travel-sized-beauty-products-t281596"" target=""_blank"">travel-sized toiletries</a> can be ridiculously overpriced and aren't great for the environment. This set is a much more eco- and budget-friendly option. The bottles are leakproof and easy to fill, squeeze and clean.</p> <p class="""">Contrary to a typical neck pillow — which is often bulky and not fully supportive — this one looks like a scarf. It wraps around the neck and supports the full weight of the head without any bobbing or straining. When not in use, it folds up compactly and is easy to wash.</p> <p class="""">Also featured in our <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/taurus-gifts-t281691"" target=""_blank"">Taurus</a> gift guide, this hammock is ridiculously portable, comfy and easy to set up and take down, all while remaining durable and secure. It creates an instant sleeping or lounging spot for any spontaneous adventure. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-packing-cubes-toiletry-bags-accessories-travel-awards-t286184"" target=""_blank"">Packing cubes</a> are perfect for the Sagittarian traveler because they help with <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/travel-packing-stay-organized-t222187"" target=""_blank"">staying organized</a>, and these are even better because the compression factor helps to save space. This set of five packing cubes in a range of different sizes are made with durable mesh fabric.</p> <p class="""">The Rumpl camping blanket has a cult following for a reason. The brand says it's made of 100% post-consumer recycled materials and it's super compact, weatherproof, durable and easy to wash. My friends who have them love to use them for all types of outdoor hangs like picnics, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-camping-gear-2023-shop-today-travel-gear-awards-t286163"" target=""_blank"">camping</a> and <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/road-trip-essentials-t224858"" target=""_blank"">road trips</a> since it’s very warm and cozy despite being so lightweight.</p> <p class="""">A good <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-setting-powder-sprays-t220461"" target=""_blank"">setting powder</a> is necessary for preventing creasing and caking, as well as keeping oil and sweat in check. This one is phenomenal, with a lightweight feel and nine shade range. For those who prefer a <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg160404"" href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=96128X1550925&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhudabeauty.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fpowder-and-setting-spray%2Fresting-boss-face-waterproof-setting-spray-HB00155.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fshop%2Fsagittariusgiftsrcna122997"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">setting spray</a>, Huda Beauty’s is my personal favorite for that, too.</p> <p class="""">These boxers merge fun and bold patterns with top-of-the-line quality. They’re known for being super soft and comfy, as well as having a huge variety of designs and colors. This two-pack has a slight Christmassy theme if your Sagittarius is into that, but there are also over a dozen other options available so one is bound to fit their style.</p> <p class="""">This is the perfect bag to keep your favorite Sagittarius from losing their phone, keys and other important items while they're on the go. It can be worn as a <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-travel-backpack-t219622"" target=""_blank"">backpack</a> or adjustable <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/amazon-chinllo-crossbody-bag-review-rcna121489"" target=""_blank"">crossbody bag</a>. It’s also water-resistant, made of recycled plastic bottles and it’s lightweight but durable. </p> <p class="""">This is for the Sagittarius whose vibe is worldly, free-spirited and on-trend while maintaining attention to detail and quality. It’s sewn and embroidered by hand by a fantastic small business. Plus, thanks to the striking design on the back, it can easily be dressed up or down. </p> <p class="""">This jumpsuit will garner lots of compliments despite only taking a few seconds to throw on. While it's definitely more of a splurge gift, it's comfortable and made to last, according to the brand. The mechanic jumpsuit look is both practical and on-trend in the most Sagittarius way.</p> <p class="""">For a curious sign like Sagittarius that loves to learn, MasterClass is the perfect platform for exploring new skill sets or sharpening existing ones. These highly-immersive virtual courses are taught by experts and there’s a wide range of subjects to choose from. I recommend checking out the ""Gardening"" course by Ron Finley or the ""Creating Outside the Lines"" course by Issa Rae.</p> <p class="""">Sagittarians tend to have brilliant ideas, but those ideas can get lost in disorganization if they’re not written down in a designated place. Sometimes they need a full-on <a href=""https://www.today.com/home/home/12-best-planners-2019-t146209"" target=""_blank"">planner</a> with calendars and structure, other times they just need a home for their to-do lists, grocery lists and middle-of-the-night epiphanies. Whatever they’re the most likely to use is what will be the most helpful, and this padfolio is both aesthetically pleasing and sleek enough to go anywhere.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/how-journal-mental-health-benefits-t255576"" target=""_blank"">Journaling</a> is a great practice for <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/10-best-gifts-astrology-lovers-t175012"" target=""_blank"">all zodiac signs</a>, but Sagittarians in particular can benefit from journals with some structure to facilitate extra expansion and inspire consistency. This is one of my favorite journals that we’ve ever recommended; the prompts are thoughtful and insightful rather than cliché, and you can start the journal on any date. </p> <p class="""">ClassPass is great for Sagittarians because, while they really benefit from a <a href=""https://www.today.com/start-today"" target=""_blank"">movement practice</a> to get some energy out, they’re often too busy (or not quite consistent enough) to stick with a membership to one place. ClassPass allows you to drop in for single classes at a huge range of fitness spaces, so you can try out any types of movement that interest you and do it on your schedule.</p> <p data-testid=""listicle__description"" class=""listicle-product__description"">Don't forget to click the coupon on the page to save 20%! iu</p> <p class="""">Neon signs as home décor provide an irreverent chutzpah and a fun ambiance. For the Sagittarius who’s proud of their zodiac (rightfully so), this LED sign featuring their symbol is vivacious without being too over the top. It’s easy to hang and made of materials that won’t break, so you don’t have to worry about leakage and broken glass.</p> <p class="""">Not only is this world map stunning with its sleek black and gold aesthetic, but you can also interact with it by scratching off the places you’ve been to and revealing the beautiful colors underneath. This is perfect for a Sagittarius with the stereotypical love of travel.  (Bonus: it happens to be made of 100% recycled paper label stock, according to the brand.) </p> <p class="""">This is the perfect Sagittarian coffee table book and well worth the hype it’s gotten since its debut in 2017. Even casual perusing of the pages will help you level up your cooking skills, whether you’re a seasoned <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-under-25-foodies-food-lovers-t105276"" target=""_blank"">foodie</a> or a beginner. It's useful and informative while remaining simple and engaging, which is perfect for a sign like Sagittarius that loves to learn without being too serious about it.</p> <p class="""">Stemless glasses are great for Sagittarians, who are a little more mess-and-breakage-prone than most zodiac signs. This set of six is dishwasher-safe and ranked highly by shoppers for its quality and durability. These universal glasses work perfectly for red wine, white wine, rosé, cocktails and more.</p> <p class="""">Foods with <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-skin-care-around-world-t226327"" target=""_blank"">international influence</a> are perfect for Sagittarius, and this za’atar blend is so flavorful and authentic. It’s a sumac-, sesame- and oregano-based blend that’s perfect for sprinkling on just about anything savory, but it’s most traditionally eaten with fresh bread and good <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg294925"" href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=96128X1550925&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcanaanpalestine.com%2Fcollections%2Fall%2Fproducts%2Fjenin-olive-oil&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fshop%2Fsagittariusgiftsrcna122997"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">olive oil</a> for breakfast. For the Sagittarius who doesn’t do well with spicy foods, za’atar is completely mild (just packed with flavor).</p> <p class="""">Another familiar item from our Taurus gift guide, this snack box is equally perfect for Sagittarius. Where Taurus needs some help getting out of their comfort zone and trying new things, Sagittarius tends to revel in it. These boxes are <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-college-care-packages-ideas-t260980"" target=""_blank"">care packages</a> featuring snacks from around the world that can be sent on a one-time or subscription basis.</p> <p class="""">The whole zodiac tea collection from Magic Hour is brilliantly crafted, and their Sagittarius tea is no exception. This is a blend of gaba oolong tea leaves with vanilla bean, cinnamon, ginger, orange, rhodiola and pomegranate — it’s fruity and mood-boosting, but calming at the same time. For a Sagittarius who would otherwise reach for some <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-coffee-lovers-t271005"" target=""_blank"">coffee</a> or an energy drink, this tea blend is gentler on the adrenals while still providing some energy.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://katyaweissandersson.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Katya Weiss-Andersson</strong></a> is a professional astrologer who specializes in Saturn returns and extra-nuanced birth chart readings.

While I usually opt for a matching athleisure set on most days, I don't have much to look forward to wearing when preparing for a slew of Zoom calls or in-person meetings.</p> <p class="""">So, I started looking for more work-appropriate alternatives for my favorite pair of leggings. This was a bit tricky considering all of the boxes they had to check: comfortable, professional and functional. Thankfully, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/amazon-new-year-sale-2023-t276301"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a> led me to a unique solution — yoga dress pants.</p> <p class="""">You read that right. Yoga pants made for the office <em>do</em> exist. With over 10,000 five-star ratings and incredible reviews, shoppers can’t stop recommending this pair by Yogipace. And now that I’ve tried them myself, I can wholeheartedly agree. Here's why:</p> <p class="""">When it comes to purchasing leggings or yoga pants, I typically worry that the material will either be too sheer or thin, to the point that they don't offer enough warmth. (In my own shopping experience, this is something that occurs all too often.) However, these Yogipace options are thicker, and therefore, not see-through, and even include a wide, pull-on waistband that I find to be incredibly comfortable.</p> <p class="""">In fact, the comfort level of these <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-leather-pants-t232572"" target=""_blank"">pants</a> is up to par with just about every pair of yoga pants that I own. I have the material to thank, which is a combination of nylon and spandex that feels as soft and lightweight as my go-to leggings.</p> <p class="""">The pair comes in seven different colors, including patterns like pinstripes and plaid. Plus, the belt loops on the waistband add an extra-chic touch. All of them are designed with two back pockets, while select styles also have two front pockets for even more storage. They are spacious enough for carrying keys or credit cards during work-related events or while I'm on the go with my dog.</p> <p class="""">As far as fit goes, I got a standard inseam of 31 inches but would’ve been better off with the petite option of 29 inches. With the current length I have now, they’re a bit too long on me and scrunch up at the bottom. The good news is that the brand offers several inseam options for <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/petite-winter-fashion-t262458"" target=""_blank"">petite</a>, regular and tall sizes, so you can find the ideal length that works for your height. There's also a few more styles available that befit an office setting, including a cropped hem and a high-waisted relaxed fit.</p> <p class="""">The only downside is that I wish the fabric provided a little bit more support. I'm used to leggings or yoga pants that pull everything together and work better for physical activities. However, these tend to slide down during walks or even errand runs.</p> <p class=""endmark"">What makes these yoga pants truly exceptional is their versatility. They look great paired with a blouse, blazer and <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/ballet-flats-amazon-review-t273938"" target=""_blank"">flats</a> for work-related events — it's not every day you find pants that give off a professional appearance yet are comfortable enough to wear all day.

If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that there’s no shortage of <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/moms/alicia-keys-celebrates-sons-birthday-special-birthday-song-rcna10233"" target=""_blank"">great birthday songs</a> out there.</p> <p class="""">There are wholesome birthday songs to play when lauded by your crew, and explicit ones for an evening with that special someone. Some <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/dolly-parton-new-song-rcna66582"" target=""_blank"">classic birthday songs</a> remind you that it’s OK to cry if you want to (thank you, Lesley Gore) or get super pumped up for a big night on the town. </p> <p class="""">Then there are funny birthday songs from the likes of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/weird-al-yankovic-madonna-romance-biopic-rcna55341"" target=""_blank"">“Weird Al” Yankovic</a> and The Smiths. They'll give you permission to dance despite impending doom, or transfer <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/people/teen-dumpster-fire-cake-honors-moms-birthday-dad-death-rcna77450"" target=""_blank"">bad birthday luck</a> to your ex (no judgment). So many fantastic birthday songs aren’t even about celebrating someone’s <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/parents/first-birthday-ideas-rcna44257"" target=""_blank"">special day</a> — but about treating every day with that same enthusiasm. </p> <p class="""">We’ve got you covered, whether it’s your big day or the <a href=""https://www.today.com/life/inspiration/birthday-wishes-rcna44381"" target=""_blank"">birthday of someone </a><a href=""https://www.today.com/life/inspiration/birthday-wishes-rcna44381"" target=""_blank"">in </a><a href=""https://www.today.com/life/inspiration/birthday-wishes-rcna44381"" target=""_blank"">y</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/life/inspiration/birthday-wishes-rcna44381"" target=""_blank"">our life</a>. Build your playlist with these hits: </p> <p class="""">This song is arguably the best and most notable birthday tune other than the classic sung around a cake. </p> <p class="""">There’s something so fun and montage-like about this hit. Listen to it if you want to feel like a main character in an ’80s movie on your birthday. </p> <p class="""">While it’s not actually about birthdays or cake, this short song is so catchy it deserves to be on every birthday song list. </p> <p class="""">A pump-up birthday song at its finest, Madonna and M.I.A. make sure you know it’s your birthday and that it means you’ll have a happy, great day. </p> <p class="""">Birthday, anniversary, wedding...this one covers them all. Even though Dido totally intended this '90s song to be ironic, it's still a fan favorite for celebrating the very best days in life. </p> <p class="""">OK, so it’s technically not a birthday song, but it should be. Who doesn’t want to hear about all the possibilities and joy they can experience on their birthday? </p> <p class="""">A slow-tempo song about someone loving you enough to make every day feel like your birthday. Not a bad way to live.  </p> <p class="""">It’s a recent addition to the birthday song lineup, but it perfectly encapsulates what it’s like when you just want to have a great day without the stress of life getting in the way. Plus, it’s a bop. </p> <p class="""">Is there a line more likely to excite a crowd than “We gon’ party like it’s your birthday?” It’s irrelevant what day of the year it is — for three minutes and 13 seconds, you will act like it’s your birthday. </p> <p class="""">Another wonderful song about treating a loved one the way you would on their birthday.</p> <p class="""">A lovely, upbeat song to the person you love on their birthday. </p> <p class="""">Gomez says that any day can be your birthday if you’re having a good enough time. Shhh, just don’t tell anyone it’s not. </p> <p class="""">Songs about birthdays and euphemisms really go hand in hand. Perry details how she’ll “Make it like your birthday every day.” </p> <p class="""">This is the song to play for your friend who hates birthdays but also secretly loves being celebrated. </p> <p class="""">The duo want you to have the birthday of your dreams, whether it’s with a special person or dancing on your own. </p> <p class="""">An absolute banger about a guy apologizing after forgetting someone’s — likely an ex’s — birthday and confessing to missing them. </p> <p class="""">This is the song to listen to on your ex’s birthday when you’re leaning into all the feels. It’s beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. </p> <p class="""">A super catchy song about that anticipation when you really like someone and want to see where it can go. Yes, the birthday suit referenced here has absolutely nothing to do with celebrating your birthday. </p> <p class="""">Everyone should have permission to cry on their birthday if they so please. </p> <p class="""">It’s no ‘American Pie,’ but McLean’s ‘Birthday Song’ will still leave you emotional as he sings about writing this for someone special. </p> <p class="""">An ode to once the party’s over and you’re just left celebrating with the one you love. </p> <p class="""">A somber but very beautiful song about being alone on your birthday. </p> <p class="""">It’s just a really lovely song celebrating how wonderful the birthday person is today and every day. </p> <p class="""">This iteration of ‘Happy Birthday’ called on the United States government to make Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday a national holiday. </p> <p class="""">For anyone who is dealing with a breakup or has a birthday over the holidays, this song goes there. </p> <p class="""">If you’ve heard anything by “Weird Al,” then this song is exactly what you’d expect him to create when deciding to wish someone a happy birthday. A notable line goes, “I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun / But that’s no reason why we shouldn’t have a little fun.” </p> <p class="""">Just a really silly reminder that you’re not getting any younger. </p> <p class="""">While the song is far from funny, the idea of devoting a whole birthday song to how it impacts someone else is quite entertaining. </p> <p class="""">Do you feel like age is just a number and youth is forever if you choose? This is the song for you. </p> <p class="""">This is for someone you don’t like and don’t wish well. As the song goes, “I’ve come to wish you an unhappy birthday.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio""><a href=""https://www.sarahpfielding.com/"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Fielding</a>, MS, is an acclaimed journalist focusing on mental health, gender rights, and social issues. She's also the co-founder of <a href=""https://www.empirecoven.com/"" target=""_blank"">Empire Coven</a>, a space for highlighting trailblazing women across New York. She has written for The Washington Post, The New York Times, Insider, Verywell, The Guardian and more. </p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

With 400+ questions spanning across multiple categories, this fast-paced game has drawn a considerable crowd — 18,000+ verified Amazon shoppers who have rated this five stars, for starters.</p> <p class="""">Upgrade Dad’s <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-coffee-lovers-t197069"" target=""_blank"">morning cup of coffee</a> with this pour-over coffee dripper from OXO. The device sits comfortably on top of most standard-sized coffee mugs. All Dad needs to do is put a filter in the cone along with his favorite coffee, and pour it over hot water. In minutes he’ll have a flavorful cup of coffee that tastes better than anything from a plastic pod.</p> <p class="""">We can always learn something from Dad, and that’s exactly what this book does. He can fill it out with stories and wisdom that you can cherish forever. A gift for him now will also be a gift passed down to future generations one day.</p> <p class="""">Does he love curling up with a good book or crossword puzzle before he hits the hay?

Commerce editor Vivien Moon plans on doing just that with this fun wine game. Place a wine bottle into this wooden contraption and watch as dad completes the puzzle to get it out before he drinks.</p> <p class="""">Make every special occasion even more so with his own pair of personalized cufflinks, customized to display his initials, or those of a loved one. Available in gold, silver or black, metals and a variety of fonts, gift him the pair that will elevate any of his nice outfits.</p> <p class="""">This pick has four card slots, three slip pockets and one large bill compartment with a bill divider so he has plenty of space for all his cash and credit cards (and maybe even a wallet-sized picture of the family, too). It also comes in a variety of colors and patterns, so you can rest assured there is an option for every dad's personal aesthetic.</p> <p class="""">They are called dad caps for a reason. Get him this aptly named accessory where he can also show off his alma mater or his child's current school. </p> <p class="""">For the dad who wants to experiment turning his whiskey on the rocks into a craft cocktail, this gift set (made in collaboration with famed distillery Woodford Reserve) allows him to do just that. The set comes with mint julep, old fashioned and whiskey sour cocktail syrups to make three classic drink options. If your dad isn’t one for alcohol, these can also be paired with sparkling water for a tasty mocktail.</p> <p class="""">Production coordinator Bella Druckman is from Chicago, which means cold winters are a norm. “I’m planning to gift my dad these cozy slippers from Dearfoams because we’re already seeing lows in the 20s,” she says. “I have a pair of Dearfoams, and they’re so soft and warm, so I can’t wait for him to receive his very own pair.”</p> <p class="""">A backpack is a practical gift for the dad who’s always carrying his work things by hand into the office. This sleek option — a recent <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/travel-awards"" target=""_blank"">Shop TODAY Travel Gear Award</a> winner — comes in a Dark Ivy or a deep gray and has ample compartments, including a padded slot that can hold a 17-inch laptop.</p> <p class="""">If he’s obsessed with pickleball (who isn’t?) or loves to relax on the golf course, this short sleeve polo from Lululemon is a great option.

Crafted of lightweight materials, the midsole also provides cushioning that will help him feel supported and comfortable all day long. </p> <p class="""">""If there's one thing i've accomplished in this life, it will be getting my dad to wear cool sandals,"" Shop TODAY editorial assistant Sierra Hoeger proudly proclaimed about her beloved pops. ""My sister and I got these Chacos for him one year for his birthday and he loved them so much, he gifted <em>his</em> dad a pair!

While he might not be building towers to make them fall over and be rebuilt again, we can almost guarantee that he’s probably hoping to get this Lego set of one of his favorite shows. He'll light up like a little kid when he sees all the Dunder-Mifflin characters he knows and loves.</p> <p class="""">These slippers are shaped from rich leather with a rubber traction sole so they're extra durable, meaning you won't have to worry about them wearing thin over time.

The added drip tray makes for minimal mess. Reviewers love the griddle because it ""heats evenly"" and is ""easy to clean.""</p> <p class="""">Stanley's recently been synonymous with the <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/viral-tumblers-water-bottles-t291581"" target=""_blank"">viral oversized tumbler trend</a>, but the rest of their product line deserves equal attention. Take, for example, their ""tough and durable"" one-liter thermos that's leakproof and designed to keep liquids hot or cold for up to 24 hours, according to the brand. ""My dad had a Stanley before Stanleys were even cool, and he takes this one on hunting trips, to work and road trips,"" adds Hoeger.</p> <p class="""">Every dad needs a knife handy for unexpected cutting or slicing. This one — featuring a sturdy beechwood handle — not only has a knife sharp enough to cut through meats and cheeses, but it's also equipped with a bottle opener and corkscrew in case he's also the family bartender.</p> <p class="""">If your dad is always cooking up a storm, his cookware means a lot to him. “My dad is always trying to perfect new types of food and right now, he’s obsessed with making bread,” Druckman says. “I’m planning on gifting my dad this cutting board with my grandma’s challah recipe, so he can braid the dough on top of her handwritten words.”</p> <p class="""">Spicy food and dads just go together like fried chicken and mashed potatoes, which is why this pick is great for any dad. This kit will guide your dad through making his own spicy sauce, complete with his own made-up name. If you’re nice, he might even let you try some.</p> <p class="""">There’s nothing we won’t do for bacon, including setting up our dad with a monthly subscription to have a few pounds of hand-cut, small batch bacon sent to his door from small butchers around the country. While this is a gift for dad, it shouldn’t be hard to get him to cook some up so we can reap the benefits of this gift, too.</p> <p class="""">Gift sets are always a great option for people who love to give thoughtful gifts without the extra effort. This apron set includes a limited-edition apron that can hold the included heat-safe chopsticks. It also comes with four types of noodles and one sauce bundle.</p> <p class="""">There is nothing like a sandwich from a New York City deli. Give Dad a taste of the Big Apple with this box that's filled with everything he needs to make a mile-high sandwich, including a pound of pastrami and corned beef, seedless rye bread, sour pickles, mustard and sauerkraut.</p> <p class="""">Most dads consider themselves the grill and smoking master of the house.

No matter how he feels when he goes to bed, he’ll wake up feeling refreshed and renewed with this.</p> <p class="""">Let Dad take his music, podcasts or e-books with him anywhere with this portable speaker. The smart speaker can last up to 10 hours on a single charge, and easily connects to his at-home Wi-Fi and phone’s Bluetooth.

It also has an “active noise cancelling” mode, that effectively blocks outside sound.  </p> <p class="""">Shopping for a dad who needs help keeping his calendar straight? We can relate. “My dad’s a busy guy, and I think he’d like a planner to help keep himself organized,” SEO editor Amanda Fama says. “This is a nice one with a faux-leather cover.” Plus, it includes December 2023, so he can start organizing his schedule ahead of the new year. </p> <p class="""">Give Dad the gift of the perfect shave with this curated travel kit. It comes with self-care essentials like an ergonomic handle (available in five two-toned hues), travel cover, rich shave gel and a water-resistant dopp bag to hold his goods in. We know Dad already looks great, but after using this, he’ll feel great, too.</p> <p class="""">Whether he’s a music fan or a musician, he’ll love this guitar-themed key hanger. “My dad’s a guitar player and I got this key holder for him for Christmas once and he uses it every day in his studio,” Fama says. “It’s super high quality and great for any <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/gifts-for-music-lovers-rcna117414"" target=""_blank"">music lover</a>!”</p> <p class="""">Help Dad keep his electronics organized with this docking station.

We would make Christmas cookies, read a holiday classic while nestled by the fire and I would watch with motherly delight as my boy opened his very first <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/gift-guide"" target=""_blank"">Christmas gift</a>.  </p> <p class="""">Meanwhile, in a place that looks way less like a Norman Rockwell painting and much more like our living room, my son looked confused as to why I was jumping around like a woodland sprite. He rejected the special Christmas pancakes I made him for breakfast, and essentially mumbled a baby-sized “bah humbug” when it came to presents. I was slightly bummed out at first, but then it hit me: My baby had no idea what day it was … because my baby was one, and he didn’t know how to read a calendar. Nor was he expected to.  </p> <p class="""">“An infant with a developmental age of 1 month makes throaty noises instead of coos, and may only hold up its chin when prone.  An infant with a developmental age of 3 months may start to chuckle, roll onto its side and examine its own fingers,” says Jeremy Jones, DO, board-certified pediatrician and associate professor of primary care at Marian University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Indianapolis, Indiana.  </p> <p class="""">“At 6 months of age, a baby should respond to his or her mother, babble, sit without support and bring an object to his or her mouth. The typical 9-month-old infant can pull to a stand and may begin to cruise,” adds Jones.  </p> <p class="""">Additional <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/pediatrician-secret-baby-milestones-rcna78747"" target=""_blank"">developmental milestones</a> around the 9-month mark, according to Jones, may include; grasping a cube with a fine pincer grip, passing objects between hands, banging two objects together, saying “mama”, imitating sounds, orienting to their own name, enjoying gesture games and recognizing familiar faces. (Notice how marking a calendar for December 25th wasn’t noted in this list of accomplishments?)</p> <p class="""">While a baby’s ability to track days, months and weeks is lacking, a baby’s ability to play is strong, says Jones. “Babies and infants actually develop through the use of play,” said Jones. </p> <p class="""">Research indicates that during infancy, babies need play time each day in order for their environment to be “<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.102.SE1.1262"" target=""_blank"">explored and discovered”</a> and so that their cognitive, social, and motor developmental skills may be <a href=""https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.uw.edu/dist/c/8227/files/2020/12/Developmental-Milestones.pdf"" target=""_blank"">“confirmed, reconfirmed, and celebrated</a>.""</p> <p class="""">While it may be tempting for <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-holiday-gifts-mom-t195207"" target=""_blank"">Mom</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/8-gift-ideas-dad-who-has-everything-t59261"" target=""_blank"">Dad</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-grandma-t269079"" target=""_blank"">Grandma</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-for-grandpas-t118489"" target=""_blank"">Grandpa</a> and anyone and everyone who is gaga for your baby to go overboard on the latest greatest whatever for a baby’s first Christmas, there’s really no need from a developmental perspective, says Jones.  </p> <p class="""">“Not that it is backed by any scientific research, but there is no need to have any toy in your home that requires batteries or an on-off switch so it can work properly,” suggests Jones.  </p> <p class="""">Instead, the best gifts for a baby’s first Christmas are the ones that encourage family togetherness, language, loving and learning, says Jones. </p> <p class="""">“Board books and other materials that encourage talking and reading are essential for a baby and infant’s overall development, “ says Jones. He also suggests blocks, ring stackers, clappers and other toys that encourage the development of an infant’s gross and fine motor skills are fantastic developmental winners.</p> <p class="""">“Any gifts for your baby or infant should be practical, simple and <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/cheap-christmas-gifts-t197268"" target=""_blank"">not break the bank</a>,"" says Jones. “The greatest gift your child can receive is your unreserved gift of self."" </p> <p class="""">Here is a list of sweet, practical and family-focused gifts for your baby’s first Christmas.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/babies/best-gifts-your-baby-s-1st-christmas-t118850#anchor-BabysfirstChristmasornaments""><strong>Ornaments</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://today.com/parents/babies/best-gifts-your-baby-s-1st-christmas-t118850#anchor-BabysfirstChristmasclothing""><strong>Clothing</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/babies/best-gifts-your-baby-s-1st-christmas-t118850#anchor-BabysfirstChristmasgifts""><strong>First Christmas gifts</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/babies/best-gifts-your-baby-s-1st-christmas-t118850#anchor-Babysfirstbooks""><strong>Books</strong></a></p> <p class="""">This popular <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-personalized-gifts-t199126"" target=""_blank"">personalized pick</a> makes it easy to take an imprint of your baby’s hand or foot and turn it into a forever keepsake.

But the film also includes documentary-style footage and interviews with Beyoncé, her family and her team, meaning that a few tracks couldn’t fit into two-hours-and-48-minute runtime. </p> <p class="""">The set list for the concert film excludes the beloved ballad “1+1.” Three tracks from the “4” album, “I Care” “Rather Die Young” and “Love on Top,” were cut, too. </p> <p class="""">Fans also shouldn’t expect to see some of the transitions that appeared on stage as Beyoncé made quick changes into her elaborate chrome outfits. </p> <p class="""">However, covers like “River Deep, Mountain High” by Ike and Tina Turner, Donna Summer’s “Love to Love You Baby” and the Diana Ross “Love Hangover” intermission did make the final cut. </p> <p class="""">Here is the complete setlist for the “Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé,” in order, according to Davis:</p> <p class="""">“Dangerously in Love 2”</p> <p class="""">“Flaws and All”</p> <p class="""">“I’m That Girl”</p> <p class="""">“Cozy”</p> <p class="""">“Alien Superstar”</p> <p class="""">“Lift Off”</p> <p class="""">“Cuff It” (with ""Sweet Dream"" sample)</p> <p class="""">“Energy”</p> <p class="""">“Break My Soul (The Queens Remix)”</p> <p class="""">“Formation”</p> <p class="""">“Diva”</p> <p class="""">“Run the World (Girls)”</p> <p class="""">“My Power” with Blue Ivy Carter</p> <p class="""">“Black Parade” with Blue Ivy Carter</p> <p class="""">“Savage” with Megan Thee Stallion</p> <p class="""">“Partition”</p> <p class="""">“Church Girl”</p> <p class="""">“Get Me Bodied”</p> <p class="""">“Before I Let Go”</p> <p class="""">“Crazy in Love”</p> <p class="""">“River Deep, Mountain High” (Ike and Tina Turner cover)</p> <p class="""">“Love Hangover” (a Diana Ross Intermission)</p> <p class="""">“Plastic Off the Sofa”</p> <p class="""">“Virgo’s Groove”</p> <p class="""">“Naughty Girl/Love to Love You Baby” (Donna Summer cover)</p> <p class="""">“Move”</p> <p class="""">“Heated”</p> <p class="""">“Kitty Kat”</p> <p class="""">“Thique”</p> <p class="""">“All Up in Your Mind”</p> <p class="""">“Drunk in Love”</p> <p class="""">“America Has a Problem” with Kendrick Lamar</p> <p class="""">“Pure/Honey”</p> <p class="""">“Summer Renaissance”</p> <p class="""">Yes! The music superstar added her hit “Drunk in Love” to the concert film, Davis confirmed. </p> <p class="""">Beyoncé only performed the 2013 track, which is from her self-titled fifth studio album, at select dates on her world tour. Now, all members of the Beyhive will get the opportunity to see her belt the sultry song on the big screen. </p> <p class="""">She also included footage from her special performance of the “America Has a Problem” remix with Kendrick Lamar. The Grammy-winning rapper joined Beyoncé on stage during her birthday show on Sept. 4 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.  </p> <p class=""endmark"">And if you're a true member of the BeyHive, Davis says you might just catch a special surprise during the end credits. </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Ariana Brockington is a trending news reporter at TODAY digital.

Just like us.</p> <p class="""">In the long-running NBC sitcom’s holiday-themed episodes, characters buy holiday presents at the last minute, have awkward encounters at holiday parties and overspend on Secret Santa. The only difference between them and us? Well, they’re just a bit funnier.</p> <p class="""">During its award-winning run from <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/office-turns-15-7-cast-members-share-their-memories-beloved-t171685"" target=""_blank"">2005 to 2013</a>, ""The Office"" followed the employees at the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. While their work was mundane, their antics were anything but in the mockumentary-style show, based on the original U.K. version. </p> <p class="""">Through nine seasons, which are available to stream on Peacock, the gang had many parties, from weddings to <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/the-office-halloween-episodes-rcna117270"" target=""_blank"">Halloween</a> to, yes, Christmas. (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal.)</p> <p class="""">To get you in the spirit this holiday season, here's a rundown of the Christmas episodes.</p> <p class="""">The show’s first Christmas episode features one of TV’s most awkward gift exchanges. When Michael Scott (Steve Carell) overspends on his Secret Santa gift — buying Ryan (B.J. Novak) a $400 video iPod — he is disappointed when he realizes that Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) stuck to the $20 maximum and hand-knit him an oven mitt. He then turns the Secret Santa into a Yankee swap, where people can steal each other's presents. Chaos ensues, and the party planning committee is not happy. The episode is also highlighted by Jim's (John Krasinski) famous teapot gift for Pam (Jenna Fischer).</p> <p class="""">In this two-part holiday episode, Michael starts with a deeply inappropriate Christmas card, featuring his own face photoshopped onto his girlfriend’s family photo. When she breaks up with him, he drowns his sorrows at Benihana and brings two waitresses back to party at the Dunder Mifflin office. Meanwhile, dueling parties are competing for guests when Karen (Rashida Jones) and Pam team up against Angela (Angela Kinsey) and the party planning committee.</p> <p class="""">When Meredith (Kate Flannery) accidentally lights herself on fire during the annual Christmas party, the office decides that it’s time to stage an intervention for her drinking habits. Also, Phyllis blackmails Angela with information that she is sleeping with Dwight (Rainn Wilson) while still being engaged to Andy (Ed Helms). This is also the episode where Dwight buys up the season’s most popular toy (a half-girl, half-unicorn doll), and sells them from his desk.</p> <p class="""">Phyllis wants nothing more than to dress up as Santa Claus, and Michael is not having it. Also, Andy accidentally terrorizes Erin when he attempts to send her every gift in ""The Twelve Days of Christmas."" Dwight and Andy also do karaoke in this episode, which is a plus.</p> <p class="""">When Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is sent out on jury duty, it's announced that Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), Michael's former love interest, will be coming to fill the position in the interim. When Michael learns this, he turns the office upside down trying to impress her with a ""classy"" and ""adult"" Christmas party. This episode also features an iconic snowball fight between Jim and Dwight.</p> <p class="""">With Michael gone, Andy is in charge now and has taken the lead as the office Santa Claus. He tries to grant everybody's wishes, buying Dwight some moon property. Meanwhile, Erin is desperately trying to avoid meeting Andy's new girlfriend, and Andy has to drive Meredith home after she gets too drunk at the Christmas party. If nothing else, watch this episode for the intense ""Carol of the Bells"" montage.</p> <p class="""">In the last season of ""The Office,"" Christmas is all about Dwight. When the office forgets to throw its own party, Dwight steps up and plans his own themed Christmas for the office: Pennsylvania Dutch. Dwight dresses up as Belsnickel (an actual Christmas legend in Germany) and serves stew and pig stomach.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Odeya is an Associate Producer at MSNBC, as well as contributing Entertainment Journalist for <a href=""http://today.com/"" target=""_blank"" data-stringify-link=""http://TODAY.com"" data-sk=""tooltip_parent"">TODAY.com</a>.

With that mind, a certain domestic doyenne is here with a caffeinated collaboration.</p> <p class="""">On Nov. 30, Dunkin’ announced it tapped Martha Stewart to introduce a new merchandise collaboration: the Dunkin’ Holiday Martini Shaker and Martini Glasses. The snazzy set of barware will be available for purchase on <a href=""https://shopdunkin.com/"" target=""_blank"">Dunkin’s merch site</a> starting Dec. 1, with <a href=""https://www.dunkindonuts.com/en/dunkinrewards"" target=""_blank"">Dunkin’ Rewards</a> members getting early access one day early to shop the collection today.</p> <p class="""">Along with the new shaker and glasses, Stewart has also whipped up a cocktail recipe that uses <a href=""https://www.dunkindonuts.com/en/menu/espresso-and-coffee/product-espresso-id1000103"" target=""_blank"">Dunkin’ Espresso</a> to create a deliciously adult beverage. The <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/people/martha-stewart-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-cover-rcna84234"" target=""_blank"">Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star</a>’s drink is a take on the espresso martini and is appropriately named the Dunkintini.</p> <p class="""">“I’ve been watching the popularity of the espresso martini growing and growing,” Stewart tells TODAY.com, mentioning her own Las Vegas eatery The Bedford by Martha Stewart. “People are starting dinner with an espresso martini. Because it’s kind of sweet and delicious, I would think that that would be more of a perfect dessert drink. But people are drinking them any time of day.”</p> <p class="""">Stewart says she approached Dunkin’ with the idea of pairing the caffeinated mixed drink with the holiday season by using an item already on Dunkin’ menus. After investigating espresso martini recipes, Stewart devised her own recipe for Dunkin’ using just three ingredients. “I don’t use sugar syrup or anything like that. It’s sweet enough with the delicious Kahlua,” she says.</p> <p class="""">Add ingredients to a cocktail shaker with ice, shake and pour into a sugar-rimmed martini glass.</p> <p class="""">Stewart also <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C0RucsWu8Gp/"" target=""_blank"">posted a short instructional video</a> showing how to make the Dunkintini and show off the sprinkle-covered shaker.</p> <p class="""">“I love espresso martinis for any holiday get together and they’re so simple to make at home with Dunkin’ espresso,” Stewart says in the video. Wearing a festive, glittery top while “Jingle Bells” plays in the background, she places a shot of espresso into a cocktail shaker along with two ounces of vodka and an ounce of coffee liqueur.</p> <p class="""">“Make that an ounce and a half,” she says, changing course by adding a little more Kahlua. After shaking it all up, she serves her drink in a sugar-rimmed martini glass, pairing the beverage with a sprinkle-topped doughnut. “How about a tempting cocktail like this and a sweet treat?”</p> <p class="""">Stewart has collaborated previously with Dunkin’, filming a tongue-in-cheek etiquette course on shaking your ice coffee. The “<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/martha-stewart-dressing-her-age-rcna121216"" target=""_blank"">successful living” advocate</a> also says she counts herself among the Ben Afflecks of the world as a diehard Dunkin’ fan.</p> <p class="""">“I have been driving back and forth, long drives to weekend houses, for a very long time,” Stewart says. “Our first weekend house was in the Berkshires, and we drove from New York every single weekend and the only place we stopped was Dunkin’. So I have a long-term relationship with them.”</p> <p class="""">Stewart says that over Thanksgiving — which she stresses was <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/news/martha-stewart-thanksgiving-not-canceled-rcna126303"" target=""_blank""><em>not </em></a><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/news/martha-stewart-thanksgiving-not-canceled-rcna126303"" target=""_blank"">canceled</a> — she traveled New England, stopping with her pups at a rest stop along the highway. Stewart says she avoids burger shops, so she ended up stopping at Dunkin’ to grab her preferred order.</p> <p class="""">“We stopped at Dunkin on the way up to Maine this weekend,” Stewart says, adding she gets a “light coffee” (one extra serving of cream) and no sugar. “And I’m not allowed to eat them but I love<em> </em>their French cruller with the sugar glaze. But I will usually take only one bite and my driver usually eats the rest.”</p> <p class="""">Now that December is upon us, you’d think Stewart is already deep into holiday party planning, but she says she hasn’t that far yet because she’s “been so busy.”</p> <p class="""">Stewart says that her dance card is quite full already, with many party invites in her inbox. “There’s like three parties every night every week. So we’re pretty busy going from place to place,” she shares.</p> <p class="""">But what will she be bringing to said parties?</p> <p class="""">“I make the most beautiful pots and pans,” Stewart says, saying that she stocked up on her own cookware line to gift as she attends seasonal soirées. “I think last year I gave everybody my kitchen tools. It’s a whole group like ladles and spoons and beautiful stainless steel and so this year, I’m going to be giving out my pots and pans.”</p> <p class="""">And what gifts does she like to get when hosting her own shindig, perhaps while preparing Dunkintinis for her guests?</p> <p class=""endmark"">“If I have a designer friend, I like getting something he or she designed,” Stewart says. “One of my friends designs sweaters. I love getting a sweater. You know, Michael Kors sends me a handbag, which I love. Those are the kinds of things I like.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Washington, D.C. native Joseph Lamour is a lover of food: its past, its present and the science behind it.

When his 16-year-old daughter, Teresa “Reese” Termulo, came down with the flu in early January 2020, it seemed like a typical case, but he was shattered when she died within a day of being diagnosed after developing complications. As </em><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/usmap.htm"" target=""_blank""><em>flu cases rise</em></a><em>, Termulo, who practices at Parkland Health in Dallas, Texas, urges people to get the flu vaccine and warns parents to be vigilant for symptoms. He shares his story with TODAY.com.</em></p> <p class="""">When people think the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu"" target=""_blank"">flu</a> is a harmless runny nose, they’re wrong. It can cause death.</p> <p class="""">My daughter, Reese, had absolutely zero health issues. She had no chronic illnesses. She was completely healthy. </p> <p class="""">She was on her high school dance team and in the top 10% of her high school class. We had already started visiting colleges. She told me she was planning on becoming a physician as well.</p> <p class="""">The morning after she was diagnosed with the flu, I said “Reese, you’re going to get better.” Those were the last words that I ever told her.</p> <p class="""">Her <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/what-are-symptoms-flu-how-protect-yourself-virus-t171203"" target=""_blank"">symptoms</a> started in the morning of January 9, 2020. She had a fever and a cough at school, so as soon as the school called, we brought her into my office and she tested positive for the flu. We started her on oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, an antiviral medication.</p> <p class="""">She felt a little bit tired so she went home to rest. But she was still doing her homework, chatting with friends, doing Snapchat and all those things that a regular teenager does. </p> <p class="""">The next morning, I asked her, “Reese, how are you feeling?” and she said her chest hurt. She had this pain under her ribs, which is muscle pain from coughing a lot.</p> <p class="""">I knew you can die from the flu, and usually it’s caused from a superimposed bacterial pneumonia after getting influenza. </p> <p class="""">The first thing as a pediatrician and a father that I’m going to do is to check her lungs, and her lungs were completely clear. I didn’t hear any signs of pneumonia. No things like wheezing or decreased breath sounds. She wasn’t breathing fast. She didn’t have symptoms that would tip me off that death was imminent.</p> <p class="""">Reese stayed home from school that day and my wife was taking care of her. They prayed the rosary. My wife wanted to read her something and the first thing that came up on her phone was this Bible verse talking about how all the time we have on Earth is a treasure. </p> <p class="""">Later that morning, Reese went back to bed and my wife went down to make her some soup. When she came back up, Reese had stopped breathing.</p> <p class="""">My wife tried to administer CPR and called 911, then me. I rushed home and when I arrived, the EMS workers were loading Reese into the ambulance. One of them said, “We can’t get her heart rate on her.”</p> <p class="""">In the emergency room, they knew that I was a doctor so eventually I was able to see them working on her. It was horrific and I knew she didn’t look alive anymore. She was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p> <p class="""">After an autopsy, the official cause of death was that Reese had the flu and superimposed <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10544681/"" target=""_blank"">strep A pneumonia</a> that was found in her lungs. </p> <p class="""">When we did a test for strep the day before, it was negative. But the group A strep spread into her blood and was even found in her brain. She had pneumonia that caused <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/what-is-sepsis.html"" target=""_blank"">sepsis</a> and overwhelmed her system. That caused her heart to stop.</p> <p class="""">You can get the flu and if you happen to get a superimposed pneumonia, it can be sudden death. My daughter died within a day of being diagnosed with the flu.</p> <p class="""">Many people asked <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-tell-if-your-kid-has-cold-flu-rsv-or-t235956"" target=""_blank"">whether it was COVID</a>, but there hadn’t been any cases yet of COVID in the U.S. then and COVID cannot kill a child that quickly. </p> <p class="""">People think the flu is a runny nose, a cough or a fever, but it’s more than that. Flu can be pneumonia. In kids, flu can cause febrile seizures. In kids with asthma, it can cause asthma attacks. It can even cause encephalopathy and death.</p> <p class="""">Reese got the flu vaccine in December 2019, but the vaccine that year did not cover influenza B/Victoria, which is the strain of flu that fatally killed her.</p> <p class="""">I still urge people to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/best-time-get-flu-shot-rcna47541"" target=""_blank"">get the flu shot</a> even though it didn’t work for my daughter. The analogy I make is: Would you drive 80 miles per hour without wearing a seatbelt? It’s illogical even though seat belts don’t always save you from death. In the same way, it’s illogical to not take the flu shot. It’s not 100% effective, but if it can reduce the chance of death if you do happen to get this superimposed pneumonia, you should take it. </p> <p class="""">As soon as you have a high fever during flu season, just do the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/testing.htm"" target=""_blank"">flu test</a>. It’s easy to do. </p> <p class="""">If it’s the flu, you need to start Tamiflu within the first two days. That’s when it’s going to be most effective. </p> <p class="""">One thing I realized as a doctor is that even though I did everything you’re supposed to do, I can’t control death. </p> <p class=""endmark"">I’m still recovering after Reese’s passing. Every moment we have is precious. Our life is temporary — it could be taken at any moment.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Dr. Cesar Termulo is a pediatrician and associate medical director at Parkland Health in Dallas, Texas.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">A.

But, about two years ago, she started having <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/health/how-often-should-you-poop-rcna84490"" target=""_blank"">constant stomach issues</a>.</p> <p class="""">At first, it was ""easy for me to just write it off,"" Hylton told TODAY's Craig Melvin. She said she'd tell herself, ""I travel, I'm on planes (and) maybe I don't have the best diet. But I love what I do, so it's worth it and I'm not going to let these symptoms hold me back.""</p> <p class="""">In August, however, she saw a segment on the TODAY show in which <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/craig-melvin-s-brother-gets-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-screening-t210742"" target=""_blank"">Craig retold the story of his brother's death</a> due to colon cancer.</p> <p class="""">""Something about that really stuck with me,"" she said. That, plus a TikTok video of a woman diagnosed with colon cancer at 24, convinced Hylton to take her symptoms more seriously.</p> <p class="""">At the same time, her symptoms were getting worse. “I was waking up (and) my face was swollen. I was having trouble going to the bathroom for days on end,” she said. </p> <p class="""">Hylton tells TODAY.com that she recalls not being able to have a bowel movement for days, and when she finally was able to, ""the pendulum swung in the other direction, almost like I couldn't leave the bathroom.""</p> <p class="""">Knowing that Black people have the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/chadwick-boseman-s-death-shed-light-colon-cancer-rates-remain-t229355"" target=""_blank"">highest rate of colon cancer</a> in the U.S. and that she has a family history of <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/disease/4-colon-cancer-symptoms-patients-diagnosed-early-rcna83790"" target=""_blank"">colon cancer</a>, Hylton said, ""I went to see a specialist who sent me for a colonoscopy.""</p> <p class="""">Three weeks after her screening — on her 30th birthday — Hylton came home from a reporting trip to find that her doctor had left her a bunch of messages. </p> <p class="""">The screening test revealed that she had a polyp in her colon. It turned out to be a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/maria-menounos-pancreatic-cancer-psa-rcna122981"" target=""_blank"">neuroendocrine tumor,</a> which is a rare type of cancer that releases hormones into the bloodstream.</p> <p class="""">""I was panicking,"" Hylton said.</p> <p class="""">Neuroendocrine tumors are rare, Dr. Nooshin Hosseini, a gastroenterologist and Hylton's doctor, said on the TODAY show during a Nov. 30 segment. </p> <p class="""">While the tumors can occur anywhere in the body, Hosseini explained, they most commonly develop in the gastrointestinal tract, specifically the small intestine.</p> <p class="""">The symptoms depend on where in the body the tumor is, Hosseini said. Neuroendocrine tumors that are found in the colon or rectum tend to have symptoms <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/colon-cancer-warning-signs-never-ignore-t108646"" target=""_blank"">similar to those of colon cancer</a>, such as:</p> <p class="""">The good news for Hylton was that her doctor caught the tumor early. ""I had a series of procedures to remove tissue and screening tests to see if the cancer had spread,"" she said. </p> <p class="""">""The last scan showed I'm all clear.""</p> <p class="""">But the experience left Hylton with some major lessons about her body and her health.</p> <p class="""">""I learned a really important lesson at 30 to listen to myself and to put myself first,"" she explained. ""I love my job. I worked hard here at NBC, and I'm not going to stop doing that. But I've learned the lesson that I really need to put my health first and not push these things off.""</p> <p class="""">It's a message she tries to send to other young professionals who might be tempted to wait to get their health concerns checked out. Taking that time for yourself isn't going to sideline you, she tells TODAY.com. Instead, it's ""what allows you to be around for other people and to reach your goals and allows you to make your dreams come true."" </p> <p class="""">Knowing that communities of color are disproportionately affected by colon cancer and may have <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/what-implicit-bias-invisible-racism-hurts-black-women-doctor-s-t189105"" target=""_blank"">trouble finding medical care they trust</a>, Hylton encourages people in those communities to push through to get the care they deserve — especially when it comes to cancer.</p> <p class="""">“I completely understand and empathize, and I see the impacts of that in my reporting and my family day to day,” Hylton says. “But my message would be that finding that person who you trust can be life-saving.” </p> <p class="""">She's also thankful that her family shared their history of health issues with her so she could be better prepared when she went to the doctor.</p> <p class="""">""On my father's side, (I have) the more classic colon cancer and the symptoms you typically think about. And then on my mom's side, my grandmother ... actually had a neuroendocrine tumor as well,"" she said. ""I'm grateful that I have a family that talks about these things so I was armed with that information.""</p> <p class="""">Hylton will continue to receive regular colonoscopies and now considers herself a ""colonoscopy evangelist."" While it may not be the most fun activity, she wants to lead by example for those around her, she says.</p> <p class=""endmark"">""Instead of being embarrassed about the bathroom symptoms,"" Hylton says, ""I really try to emphasize that I feel so good and so proud of myself for taking action.""</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"
https://www.today.com/health/mystery-dog-illness-2023-rcna125553,A potentially fatal mystery illness in dogs is spreading in the US.

The typical first symptom is a cough, which may last for weeks or even months. In some dogs, the cough turns into pneumonia, causing them to struggle to breathe.</p> <p class="""">""It seems to happen very, very quickly — to go from this cough that’s just won’t go away ... and then all of a sudden they develop this pneumonia,"" Dr. Lindsey Ganzer, veterinarian and CEO at North Springs Veterinary Referral Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">It's unclear how many dogs have developed the illness, as most states are not formally tracking cases. However, anecdotally, veterinarians in critical care settings tell TODAY.com that they've seen dozens of cases since the fall, and these rates have not slowed.</p> <p class="""">Dr. Gina Kettig, veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, said in <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/how-to-protect-your-dog-as-mysterious-virus-spreads-around-us-198292037753"" target=""_blank"">a Nov. 20 segment on TODAY</a> that she's seen ""a plethora of these infections and it's concerning. ... We are using our isolation ward heavily with all of these infections.""</p> <p class="""">Ganzer says she's seen over 30 dogs with what she believes to be the condition since October. Lately, two or three dogs a day with a mysterious cough have been coming to her hospital, and most have needed hospitalization. She's lost four dogs to the illness, but they all had severe pneumonia by the time she started treating them.</p> <p class="""">Ganzer notes that the illness seems to be affecting dogs regardless of age, size or breed, but it's most common in dogs who recently spent time with other dogs, such as at a kennel or doggy day care.</p> <p class="""">That's why many veterinarians are urging dog owners to keep their canines out of boarding facilities, groomers and anywhere else dogs tend to gather in groups for the time being.</p> <p class="""">“I think concern is fine,” Dr. Kurt Williams, director of Oregon Veterinary Diagnostics Lab, who’s been researching the illness for the past month and a half, tells TODAY.com. It's not a time for dog owners to ""become paralyzed with fear,"" he adds.</p> <p class="""">Dogs with this mystery illness usually have coughing, sneezing, eye or nose discharge, are abnormally tired, and do not test positive for any common causes of canine respiratory illness, the Oregon Department of Agriculture noted in <a href=""https://www.oregonvma.org/news/reports-of-severe-canine-infectious-respiratory-disease-in-oregon"" target=""_blank"">a Nov. 9 press release</a>. </p> <p class="""">Typically, dogs with respiratory illnesses have a cough for seven to 10 days, but some vets have seen an uptick in dogs with coughs lasting weeks to months that don't respond to treatment, the Colorado Department of Agriculture said in <a href=""https://ag.colorado.gov/canine-respiratory-disease"" target=""_blank"">a Nov. 22 statement</a>.</p> <p class="""">Dogs are most likely to contract the mystery illness by being in close contact with numerous other dogs — so places like day care, dog parks, groomers or boarding kennels, Ganzer explains.</p> <p class="""">Since mid-August, the Oregon Department of Agriculture has received reports of over 200 cases of the illness from veterinarians in the state.</p> <p class="""">An Oregon Department of Agriculture spokesperson tells TODAY.com that cases are still being reported and that the department is working with other authorities to try to find the cause of the illnesses. Veterinarians who see cases are encouraged to report them to the Oregon Department of Agriculture.</p> <p class="""">The Colorado Department of Agriculture is not currently tracking case numbers but shared that ""veterinarians (in the state) are currently reporting that they are seeing double the number of cases than what is typically seen during a canine infectious respiratory disease outbreak.""</p> <p class="""">Dr. Amanda Cavanagh, head of urgent care services at Colorado State University James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, in Fort Collins, Colorado, tells TODAY.com this past summer she started seeing cases of dogs with coughs lasting several weeks or longer, and the trend has continued into the fall. She estimates her caseload of coughing dogs has doubled over the past month or so.</p> <p class="""">While dogs with a contagious cough are common in veterinary settings, Cavanagh notes that she normally sees cases decrease in the fall as temperatures drop and fewer dogs are gathering at parks. ""But this year, the spike has stayed high,"" she explains.</p> <p class="""">In its press release, the Oregon Department of Agriculture noted that the illness can progress in three ways: </p> <p class="""">Cavanagh has witnessed all three scenarios play out at her hospital. Recently, she's seen more dogs than usual with a long-lasting upper respiratory infection who then develop pneumonia from a secondary bacterial infection. In a small subset of these dogs, the pneumonia can be ""really severe,"" she explains.</p> <p class="""">Of the dogs she's treated, she says most who develop pneumonia respond to antibiotics, and many with a long-lasting cough recover with time and never get pneumonia. But of those who develop the severe pneumonia, some have died or had to be euthanized.</p> <p class="""">""That really bad pneumonia, historically, is very, very rare. Maybe I would see one case a year,"" Cavanagh says. ""We've seen a handful of them in the past weeks to months.""</p> <p class="""">Because most states are not tracking case numbers, it's not known exactly how many dogs have died from the illness. </p> <p class="""">The Oregon Department of Agriculture tells TODAY.com that it does not know how many dogs have died from the illness in the state.</p> <p class="""">However, it is confirmed that some dogs in the U.S. have died from the mystery illness.</p> <p class="""">The Colorado Department of Agriculture said in a statement that ""in rare cases, the canine patients progress quickly from pneumonia to death."" The Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biological Sciences also said the illness has resulted in ""some fatalities.""</p> <p class="""">Ganzer estimates that five dogs at her hospital have died from the illness. Cavanagh says she's also lost some dogs to it. Williams says he was recently contacted about running tests on a dog that died from severe respiratory disease.</p> <p class="""">While this mystery dog illness is making headlines in 2023, Ganzer notes that it's been around since last year. Her hospital has been sending off samples from the dogs to University of New Hampshire’s Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory, which has been studying the illness since 2022.</p> <p class="""">One of the biggest challenges of this mystery illness is defining what cases “fall under this umbrella of this particular entity that we’re all investigating,” Williams says. That’s because dogs can develop a cough for many reasons, and it takes time to rule out known causes.</p> <p class="""">“We’re still trying to pin down a potential cause or causes for the entity. At least in Oregon, it’s given us some some challenges,” Williams says.</p> <p class="""">Researchers at University of New Hampshire’s Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory told NBC News that they've identified a bacterium that could be behind the surge in respiratory illness in dogs, but more testing is needed to confirm.</p> <p class="""">The bacterium is smaller than normal bacteria and hasn't been known to cause disease before, Dr. David Needle, pathology section chief at the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the University of New Hampshire, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mystery-dog-illness-respiratory-what-know-rcna125992"" target=""_blank"">told NBC News</a>. Smaller bacteria can sometimes cause worse illness because it's easier for them to bypass the dog's immune system and get into the respiratory tract and lungs, Dr. Karl Jandrey, professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, told NBC News.</p> <p class="""">According to a Nov. 27 statement from the AVMA, cases that match the description of the mystery dog illness have been reported, officially or anecdotally, in:</p> <p class="""">The AVMA is monitoring cases of canine respiratory illness and in contact with state officials. The association reiterated that the cause of the illness is still unknown.</p> <p class="""">In recent weeks, there have also been multiple reports of outbreaks of a deadly respiratory illness in dogs at animal shelters in the U.S. The San Diego Humane Society has lost four dogs to a ""severe respiratory canine illness,"" <a href=""https://www.sdhumane.org/about-us/news-center/stories/strep-zoo.html"" target=""_blank"">according to a Nov. 15 press release</a>. </p> <p class="""">However, the outbreak at San Diego Humane Society has been linked to two particular bacteria, Strep zoo and Mycoplasma. Dr. Zarah Hedge, chief medical officer at San Diego Humane Society, tells TODAY.com that she believes the outbreak at her shelter and others she's heard about — such as <a href=""https://animalfoundation.com/whats-going-on/blog/animal-foundation-seeing-spike-canine-respiratory-diseases-among-dogs-las-vegas-valley"" target=""_blank"">one in Las Vegas</a> — are not related to the mystery dog illness. That's because Strep zoo and Mycoplasma are easily treatable with the right antibiotics, which saved many dogs at her shelter during the recent outbreak. Also, the sick dogs she saw didn't have a long-term cough, she says.</p> <p class="""">The AVMA also confirmed there's no indication of a connection between the outbreaks.</p> <p class="""">That said, Hedge is still concerned about the damage that severe respiratory infections, both known and unknown, can cause in dogs, especially in shelters.</p> <p class="""">""We are seeing numbers of dogs coming into shelters that we haven't seen in a very long time,"" Hedge says. ""A lot of shelters across the country are overcrowded, and it just sets you up for disease outbreaks.""</p> <p class="""">Symptoms of the mystery dog illness include:</p> <p class=""""><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><em> </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/veterinarian-viral-video-dog-coughing-rcna126783"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>What does coughing in a dog sound like? Vet explains in viral video</em></strong></a></p> <p class="""">""Owners should monitor their dogs closely for progressive coughing that may be accompanied by signs of ocular or nasal discharges and sneezing,"" the AVMA said in a statement.</p> <p class="""">""Please consult your veterinarian immediately if those clinical signs develop, particularly if your dog concurrently loses its appetite, has trouble breathing, is coughing continually, or is extremely lethargic.""</p> <p class="""">Ganzer stresses that any dog owners who notice their dog coughing, especially if they recently spent time with lots of other dogs, such as at a day care, kennel or dog park, should be taken to the vet right away. You shouldn't wait to see if the cough clears up on its own as earlier treatment makes a big difference in recovery, she adds.</p> <p class="""">However, for many dog owners, the early signs of coughing can be difficult to recognize, Dr. Michele Forbes, Dr. Michele Forbes, owner of Compassionate Care Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says.</p> <p class="""">""Rarely do (dog owners) identify a cough until it becomes an overt problem and it’s clearly coming from the chest,” Forbes explained in <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@drforbeez/video/7304670103684074794"" target=""_blank"">a now-viral TikTok</a>.</p> <p class="""">As a result of owners not noticing the early coughing or confusing it for something else, like throat-clearing or gagging, some dogs are arriving at vet facilities in more advanced stages of the condition, which can make it more difficult to treat, Forbes tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">Some tips to help identify early signs of coughing in dogs:</p> <p class="""">Ganzer says her No. 1 tip is to keep dogs from areas where they're likely to come into contact with other dogs (but do not delay taking your dog to the vet for needed medical care). Cavanagh advises dog owners across the country, regardless of whether they live in a state where cases have been reported, to follow this guidance.</p> <p class="""">Keeping dogs out of these situations may be difficult for many families as the holidays approach because many people rely on boarding kennels when they travel. However, Ganzer says to avoid boarding dogs over the holidays ""if at all possible,"" adding that she's ""so scared"" about what may happen with the mystery illness after dogs across the country are boarded for the holidays.</p> <p class="""">""I understand that there are circumstances that are unavoidable and that some people have to (board their dogs), but I would not take this lightly,"" she explains. ""If there's somebody that can even just come to your house and let your dog out, that's a better option.""</p> <p class="""">In light of the situation, Cavanagh says she's been keeping her two dogs at home and avoiding settings where they may come in contact with other dogs. She also suggests avoiding any nose-to-nose street greetings between strange dogs.</p> <p class="""">Williams agrees that it’s “prudent” to be concerned right now about putting dogs in scenarios where they may come into contact with  many other dogs. If you need to put your dog in such a situation, he suggests contacting your vet ahead of time for guidance.</p> <p class="""">To keep your dog safe and healthy overall, the AVMA recommends keeping up to date with vaccinations. ""While the existing vaccines may not specifically target this unknown infection, maintaining overall health through routine vaccinations can help support a dog’s immune system in combating various infections,"" it said. It stresses the following vaccines: Bordetella, Adenovirus type 2, and parainfluenza combined with the injectable influenza H3N2 vaccine.</p> <p class="""">Be sure to give your dog two weeks after vaccination before interacting with other dogs so they can build up immunity.</p> <p class="""">If your dog is sick, consult a vet right away, as early testing can help with treatment, and keep the dog away from other dogs to avoid spreading the illness, the Colorado Department of Agriculture advises. </p> <p class="""">While it's unlikely a humans can get sick with the respiratory illness, because the cause is still unknown, the AVMA suggests thoroughly washing hands after handling any dogs.</p> <p class="""">If your dog has been diagnosed with the mystery coughing illness, Ganzer suggests asking your veterinarian about submitting a sample to a research lab to help with the efforts to identify the cause.</p> <p class=""endmark""><em>Caroline Kee contributed reporting.</em></p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Maura Hohman is the senior health editor for TODAY.com and has been covering health and wellness news and trends since 2015, when she graduated from journalism school.

Regardless of the size of your holiday table, the night before Christmas should be marked with a memorable meal.</p> <p class="""">We’ve got a plethora of ideas for those who partake in the Italian-American tradition of the <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/feast-seven-fishes-origin-italian-seafood-recipes-t204538"" target=""_blank"">Feast of the Seven Fishes</a> on Christmas Eve. Think indulgent seafood spreads, celebratory shellfish pastas and more. For those who prefer the classic charm of a traditional roast — be it turkey, lamb, or ham — the options are virtually limitless. From succulent prime rib to flavorful leg of lamb and juicy rib-eyes, the choices abound. If a mouthwatering <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/pasta-recipes-t252428"" target=""_blank"">baked cheesy pasta</a> is more your style, we've got you covered. And for those opting for simplicity, explore our quick, one-skillet recipes that will still mark the day with a feeling of celebration and warmth.</p> <p class="""">No matter how your family celebrates, boy, do we have a Christmas Eve dinner idea for you. (Fifty of them to be exact!) From the fragrant aromas of slow-roasting meat to the comforting burble of a cheesy baked pasta, each of these dishes will add a special touch to your festive gathering. Whatever your Christmas Eve preferences may be, this compilation promises a memorable meal that will set the tone for the holiday season.</p> <p class="""">Get ready to elevate your Christmas Eve dinner to a whole new level with this curated collection of fifty delicious recipes.</p> <p class="""">Don’t let the lengthy process intimidate you — a classic Beef Wellington is a labor of love that’s well worth the effort. Seared beef tenderloin is covered with a finely chopped paste of mushrooms, shallots, garlic and butter (duxelles), wrapped in puff pastry, then baked until golden. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the beef is perfectly tender before cutting into that highly awaited first-slice.</p> <p class="""">Pull out all the stops with this shortcut lasagna that’ll taste like it took all day to make. Good news — it didn’t. Layer jarred marinara sauce with ricotta, pre-shredded mozzarella, cooked sausage, ground beef and onions with dried lasagna noodles. The uncooked lasagna sheets will become al dente while submerged right in the cheesy sauce and baked in the oven.</p> <p class="""">This Italian restaurant menu staple is shockingly easy to make at home in just one skillet. First, sear shrimp until pink, then immediately set aside to avoid overcooking. Then combine a healthy amount of chili flakes with onion, garlic, oregano, diced canned tomatoes and clam juice to create the flavorful spicy sauce. Serve with crusty bread for dipping.</p> <p class="""">Nothing says the <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/christmas-dinner-ideas-t273742"" target=""_blank"">holidays</a> like a spiral ham in the center of the table. Instead of a store-bought spice packet, dress it up with a glaze made with maple syrup, molasses, mustard, apple cider, red curry paste and garlic. Round out this sweet-yet-savory main with an assortment of your favorite side dishes.</p> <p class="""">The beauty of cacio e pepe lies in its simplicity, so don’t over complicate it. Pecorino Romano, freshly cracked black pepper, butter and pasta water meld to coat the noodles in a silky smooth sauce. As with any great Italian dinner, be sure to pair this rich pasta dish with a glass of wine.</p> <p class="""">If you’re celebrating the Feast of the Seven Fishes, this seafood pasta dish is a must. Wide tagliatelle is piled high with clams, mussels, <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/recipes/best-shrimp-recipes-rcna82019"" target=""_blank"">shrimp</a> and calamari in a white wine sauce, and flecked with sundried tomatoes, thinly sliced chiles and fresh herbs.</p> <p class="""">Take cookbook author Ali Rosen’s advice and use her oven method for making perfectly cooked steak. For foolproof rib-eyes, cook them in the oven until they reach an internal temperature of 115 F, then crank up the broiler and get the outsides charred with gorgeous crispy bits.</p> <p class="""">There’s just something about serving seafood that makes a meal feel celebratory. Plump shrimp are the star of this deceivingly simple pasta dish made with a spicy tomato butter sauce. Once you realize how easy this is to make for Christmas Eve, you’ll want to have it on regular weeknights too.</p> <p class="""">Welcome dinner guests with the savory aroma of this elevated beef stew. For a wow-worthy main course, braise beef short ribs until they’re fall-off-the-bone tender. Serve over mashed potatoes to sop up every last drop of the flavorful braising liquid.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/recipes/macaroni-and-cheese-recipes-rcna127177"" target=""_blank"">Mac and cheese</a> is a welcome addition to any holiday spread and if you bring this baked version, you’ll definitely earn your seat at the table. Pro tip: don’t skimp out on the cheese. Sharp yellow or white cheddar, Gruyere or Swiss, all work wonders here. Make it ahead, cover and store in the fridge until it’s showtime and bake until bubbling.</p> <p class="""">Turkey isn’t just for <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/recipes/best-thanksgiving-side-dishes-rcna123179"" target=""_blank"">Thanksgiving</a>! Switch up your typical bird recipe with this Latin-inspired marinade made with peppers, paprika, garlic, cilantro and orange juice. Coat the turkey with an herby compound butter seasoned with thyme, oregano and paprika to keep the meat juicy. To take it over the top, brush the bird with guava jam before broiling for the ultimate sticky-sweet glaze.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/news/giada-de-laurentiis-leaving-food-network-rcna70143"" target=""_blank"">Giada De Laurentiis</a> swears by this creamy lobster linguine recipe for a holiday feast. For the sauce, crisp bacon, shallots, garlic and red pepper flakes in a skillet, then stir in tomato purée and cream. Toss in pre-cooked linguine, grated Parmesan, pasta water, arugula, fresh herbs, peas and steamed lobster for a restaurant-worthy recipe at home.</p> <p class="""">Think of your slow-cooker like a sous chef. For a delectable pot roast, start by searing chuck roast in a hot skillet. Once nice and brown, place the meat in the slow cooker and top with onion, carrots, celery, beer, stock, herbs and spices and let it cook while you wrap presents and set the table.</p> <p class="""">This swordfish recipe might sound like a dish you’d order off a restaurant specials list, but wait until you learn how simple it is to make at home. Sear swordfish steaks until charred and cooked through, then serve atop a bed of sautéed eggplant, bell peppers, onion, celery, garlic, anchovies and capers for a burst of punchy flavor in every bite.</p> <p class="""">You can’t go wrong with a simple-yet-stunning roast chicken for Christmas Eve dinner. In Curtis Stone’s wine country-inspired recipe, roasted clusters of red grapes add a welcome hint of sweetness to balance out the creamy burrata and buttery white wine reduction.</p> <p class="""">Treat your guests to a rib roast this holiday season — the kind of cut you’d only serve on special occasions. As impressive as it is to serve, with just six ingredients (prime rib roast, black pepper, salt, garlic, rosemary and olive oil), rib roast isn’t all that difficult to make. Be sure to choose bone-in roast for the juiciest results.</p> <p class="""">Crack open a can of hard cider to make this cider-roasted pork tenderloin. Along with maple syrup, fennel, peppercorns, coriander, ginger, rosemary and cinnamon, the cider makes a festive marinade for the meat. Once cooked, serve warm with roasted plum chutney for holiday flair.</p> <p class="""">This no-cook tomato sauce is music to a stressed-out-host’s ears. Boil homemade or store-bought cheese ravioli and toss in a simple sauce made of roughly chopped tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil. The residual heat from the hot ravioli will cause garlic and herbs to bloom, adding even more aromatic flavor in every bite.</p> <p class="""">Skip that trip to the steakhouse this Christmas Eve. Here’s a foolproof technique to use on expensive cuts of steak like rib-eye: the reverse sear. Bake the steaks first at a low temperature, then sear for buttery, tender slices of meat.</p> <p class="""">In Ina we trust. Use Garten’s method to ensure that your pork tenderloins turn out utterly juicy and tender. Ina seasons her pork with rosemary and thyme, then wraps it in prosciutto before roasting. Instead of jarred applesauce, take this recipe up a notch with a homemade apple chutney made with Granny Smith apples, onion, ginger, orange juice, raisins and brown sugar.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/grilling-recipes-t255916"" target=""_blank"">Fire up the grill</a> to make this show-stopping leg of lamb. The prep is simple: marinate the meat in a mixture of mint, lemon zest and juice, chopped garlic, red pepper flakes and olive oil. Be sure to reserve some dressing for drizzling over the finished lamb.</p> <p class="""">Roasting a whole chicken is always worth the effort — but this recipe is surprisingly low-fuss. To make this chicken a stand-out, rub with garlic butter and coat with salt, pepper and tarragon, lemon juice and white wine. Then serve over cherry tomatoes roasted in olive oil, salt and pepper.</p> <p class="""">Celebrate Christmas Eve, Greek-style. Season a boneless leg of lamb with rosemary, oregano, lemon zest and garlic and rest over halved baby potatoes and a lemony broth. As the meat and potatoes cook together all in one pot, make homemade tzatziki with grated cucumbers, garlic, lemon juice, Greek yogurt and fresh mint.</p> <p class="""">Martha Stewart’s recipe for spicy lobster with linguine is as impressive as it sounds. First, steam lobsters in water and vodka until they turn bright red. Remove the meat, making sure to keep the claw meat intact, then serve atop linguine tossed in a simple tomato sauce. Garnish with freshly torn mint and enjoy for Christmas Eve dinner.</p> <p class="""">As this large spiral ham cooks, make a glaze with cider, maple syrup, brown sugar, mustard, vinegar and the secret ingredient: pumpkin spice. Coat the ham with this warming glaze and continue baking until the meat is caramelized. After the big meal, save the leftover ham bone to add to pea or lentil soup after the holiday madness subsides.</p> <p class="""">This fancy-sounding seafood stew was popularized by Italian-American immigrants in San Francisco. Cook fennel, onion and jalapeños in a tomato-based, white wine broth. Then steam clams, mussels, shrimp and cod in intervals until cooked. As an added homage to the Golden State, this recipe also calls for local Dungeness crab and is served with roasted sourdough garlic bread.</p> <p class="""">Let endlessly customizable mac and cheese serve as a blank canvas this Christmas Eve. For this version, use a blend of sharp cheddar, Parmesan, pepper jack, then fold in large chunks of buttery, poached lobster meat. Top with more Parmesan and cook until brown and bubbly.</p> <p class="""">Alex Guarnaschelli’s spaghetti alla vongole recipe is a tribute to her late mother. Dry white wine, clam juice, garlic lemon juice and butter combine to form a silky sauce. Steam four pounds of Littlenecks in the briny sauce, then toss with cooked linguine, scallions and fresh parsley before serving.</p> <p class="""">Why make linguine and clams when you can make linguine with clams and mussels?! Cook littlenecks and mussels in a white wine and garlic sauce. Serve with linguine dressed with a bright salsa verde made with parsley, chives, fennel, capers, garlic, lemon zest, mint and olive oil.</p> <p class="""">All you need to make Al Roker’s favorite holiday dinner is three pounds of tri-color potatoes, two racks of lamb, salt, pepper and olive oil. Roast the potatoes in olive oil and salt and pepper, then sear the lamb chops in a hot cast iron skillet before finishing off in the oven. Dinner is served!</p> <p class="""">Every great holiday dinner starts with a bountiful appetizer spread. Take a page out of Katie Lee Biegel’s book and make this creamy clam chowder dip to enjoy before the main event. Guests will love the festive presentation of the hot dip served in a sourdough bread bowl — perfect for ripping and dipping.</p> <p class="""">If you have arborio rice and chicken stock in your pantry, you’re less than an hour away from the perfect side dish for your holiday main. This creamy Parmesan risotto requires just 45 minutes of active time — and it’s mostly idle stirring. Spoon hot broth ladleful by ladleful until the rice soaks up all the liquid and becomes creamy. Fold in Parmesan at the last minute, season and serve.</p> <p class="""">Chicken paillard meets veal saltimbocca in this impressive mash-up of an entrée. To make it, crisp up prosciutto and sage, then cook a thin chicken cutlet until brown. Serve topped with arugula dressed with lemony olive oil, crispy prosciutto, sage and balsamic.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/set-it-forget-it-these-27-slow-cooker-recipes-will-t68571"" target=""_blank"">Slow-cooker</a> to the rescue! Use your slow-cooker to make an easy marinara sauce with onion, canned crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes and spices. After rolling your meatballs, place them in the sauce, then set and forget until the meatballs are cooked. Once done, remove the meatballs and replace with water and spaghetti. Cover with the lid while the noodles cook, then serve.</p> <p class="""">You don’t need an elusive reservation to make these Carbone restaurant-style meatballs at home. The secret to these coveted beauties is a blend of ground beef, veal and sweet Italian sausage. Instead of breadcrumbs, homemade croutons are softened in whole milk and stirred into the meatball mixture. The soaked bread makes them tender and keeps the meatballs from falling apart.</p> <p class="""">Garlic, butter, lemon juice, shrimp — what could be bad?! Cook the shrimp first (this will prevent it from getting rubbery). Set the shrimp aside and whip together the signature sauce by deglazing the pan with wine and adding garlic, butter and red pepper flakes. Add lemon juice, then reduce the sauce before adding in cooked pasta and prepared shrimp.</p> <p class="""">Vodka sauce fans, give that box of penne a break and swap it for store-bought gnocchi. Stir a package of pillowy gnocchi into homemade vodka sauce, then top with more cheese and Parmesan-panko breadcrumbs. Finish this family-friendly casserole under the broiler for a stunning baked pasta dish you’ll want to pile on your plate.</p> <p class="""">A good eggplant Parmesan is truly a labor of love — but it’s worth it for a beloved holiday entrée. First peel and salt the eggplant to draw out some of its natural moisture. (No one likes a soggy Parm!) Then, roast the eggplant before layering with panko, mozzarella, and marinara. Patience is the name of the game here. The eggplant is ready when the top layer of cheese is browned and bubbling.</p> <p class="""">The perfect chicken Milanese hinges on the platonic ideal of a chicken cutlet. To achieve that level of perfection, coat a thin chicken cutlet in flour, egg and breadcrumbs before frying in good olive oil. You’ll know it’s done by the color of the breading — it should be evenly golden brown. Fry them off and serve with a simply dressed arugula salad.</p> <p class="""">The secret to restaurant-quality scallops is a searing hot pan. Place dry, salted sea scallops a layer of oil in a scorching hot pan. They’ll be ready to flip once a crust forms on the bottom (1 to 3 minutes). For added flavor, add butter and thyme to the pan and baste the scallops.</p> <p class="""">Peking-style roast duck was made to serve a crowd. This version is marinated with honey, dark soy sauce, Chinese five spice and brown sugar, which gives the skin a caramelized sweetness. Pro tip: poke small holes in the skin for optimal crispiness.</p> <p class="""">Wine isn’t just for drinking this holiday season — it’s also for cooking! To make this visually stunning pasta dish, sauté butter and garlic, then deglaze the pot with an entire bottle of light-bodied red wine and bring to a boil. Cook the pasta directly in the wine (yes, seriously) until al dente and finish with butter, pine nuts, feta, lemon juice and herbs.</p> <p class="""">Make a giant pot of Manhattan clam chowder (the red one!) for a delightful first course. Loaded with bacon, celery, potatoes, carrots, peppers, onions, and littleneck clams, this soup will just quell your hunger before diving into the rest of the mains.</p> <p class="""">This slow-cooker chicken and dumplings recipe is comfort in a bowl. Make the chicken stew base with stock, onions, potatoes, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and thyme. The dumplings mixture is simple: Bisquick, milk and chives. Small spoonfuls of dumplings will expand and rise to the top as it cooks.</p> <p class="""">Few meals are as craveable and cozy as chicken pot pie, with its creamy chicken and veggie-stuffed filling and golden brown crust. This mini recipe makes for a fun presentation, but can easily be turned into larger portions by baking the dough and filling in two pie pans instead of individual ramekins.</p> <p class="""">If this is your first time making tamales from scratch, follow this recipe by Rick Martînez, straight out of his cookbook <em>Mi Cocina: Recipes and Rapture from My Kitchen in Mexico</em>. The multi-step process is best made with a few sous chefs, so recruit your family to divide and conquer.</p> <p class="""">This cozy pasta dish will warm you from the inside out. Cook jumbo shells in salted boiling water but remove while still firm. Stuff with a ricotta filling that’s seasoned with grated Parmesan, nutmeg, basil and a beaten egg. Nestle the shells in a baking dish with marinara and cheese, then bake and broil to finish.</p> <p class="""">Feeling ambitious? Make this classic French braised coq au vin, inspired by a menu item at Café Boulud in Manhattan. The secret to the intensely flavorful braising liquid is reducing two full bottles of red wine. Serve the finished braise with buttery spaetzle, which is deceptively simple to make from scratch.</p> <p class="""">Take the ingredients from <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/caprese-salad-t285733"" target=""_blank"">classic Caprese salad</a> — tomatoes, mozzarella, balsamic vinegar and basil — and transform them into a delectable accompaniment for chicken breasts. Cook chicken, then add tomatoes, garlic and capers into the pan, stirring frequently to release the fond. Top the chicken with pesto and mozzarella and cook until melted.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Low and slow is the name of the game for this roasted salmon recipe from Eric Ripert. First, season a salmon filet with white pepper, dill, lemon zest and olive oil. Let the flavors meld in the fridge for an hour, then bake in the oven until the fish is cooked through and tender.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Lauren Masur is a food and lifestyle writer.

Unfortunately, that's not the case, as evidenced by multitudes of <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/naomi-osaka-withdraws-australian-open-rcna64799"" target=""_blank"">Achilles strains</a> and rampant knee instability. Not only that, but if you want to walk or run faster or jump higher, calf strength is key.</p> <p class="""">Most of us know that having strength in the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/lower-body-workout-exercises-rcna21831"" target=""_blank"">lower body</a> improves <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-exercises-for-seniors-rcna49137"" target=""_blank"">balance and stability</a> while walking, standing, running and performing everyday movements. Yes, we are strengthening the calves to some extent when we do those things, but when it comes to strength workouts most of us have a tendency to neglect the lower leg entirely.</p> <p class="""">Most lower-body workouts <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-butt-exercises-rcna39297"" target=""_blank"">focus on the glutes</a> and legs, but some simple shifts can helps us use those same — or similar — movements to target the calves. Integrating calf exercises into your fitness regimen can be easy and fun. In fact, you're probably already doing some of the best calf exercises without even knowing it! All you have to do is fine tune your movements to target those muscles. </p> <p class="""">When most people think of leg strength, they tend to think about the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-leg-exercises-rcna21979"" target=""_blank"">bigger muscles in the thighs</a> — the quads and hamstrings. Those muscles are obviously major players in both fitness and everyday life, but they can't do much without the calves.</p> <p class="""">The calf muscles push you forward when you run or walk, allow you to jump, help you rotate your ankles, keep your knees stable and flex your feet. So if you're skipping calf strength training, you are literally cutting yourself off at the knee. </p> <p class="""">Your calf muscles are responsible for supporting a lot of the load from your lower body, and they propel you forward when doing activities like <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-benefits-workout-rcna16871"" target=""_blank"">walking</a> and running. The stronger your calves are, the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/what-fartlek-run-faster-training-technique-t241836"" target=""_blank"">faster you’ll be able to run</a>, the higher you’ll be able to jump, and the less likely you’ll be to get injured while working out.</p> <p class="""">The muscles that make up the calves are gastrocnemius and soleus. Each of them play a critical role in walking, running, jumping and supporting good posture.</p> <p class="""">Gastrocnemius comprises the bulk of the calf and is therefore the most visible. It connects from the femur — aka the leg bone — all the way down to the ankle by way of the achilles tendon. </p> <p class="""">Having strong gastrocnemius muscles not only gives the legs a shapely appearance, it also helps propel you forward. Gastrocnemius is the primary muscle that's activate when you lift your heel off the ground, so if it's strong and healthy you are able to move faster, easier. </p> <p class="""">Because gastrocnemius crosses two joints — the knee and the ankle — it is more prone to strain and injury than muscles that only cross one joint. Think of it this way: Because the gastrocnemius has multiple jobs in everyday activities like walking — stabilizing the knee and flexing the ankle — it has more opportunities for injury.</p> <p class="""">The soleus muscle is further away from the skin, underneath the gastrocnemius muscles, so you can't really see it. But that doesn't mean that it isn't important! It assists the gastrocnemius in flexing the ankle and helps to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/ankle-mobility-exercises-rcna34511"" target=""_blank"">keep the ankle joint stable</a>. That means that soleus is important for helping you move and stabilizing the lower leg in a way that supports good posture. </p> <p class="""">A lot of #legday exercises that are already in your fitness arsenal can be used to target the calves. Here are a few.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-do-a-lunge-rcna32739"" target=""_blank"">Lunges</a> engage the calves in multiple ways. The soleus muscle helps stabilize the ankles while gastrocnemius helps stabilize the knees. If you want to level up the calf effort in your lunges, try lifting the heel of the front foot. </p> <p class="""">You can make any <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/squat-variations-t245044"" target=""_blank"">squat</a> into a great calf workout by lifting the heels — called a plie squat. You can alternate which heel you lift or do both at the same time if you're feeling balanced. </p> <p class="""">Anything that involves jumping strengthens your calves — and you can add a jumping, or <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/plyometric-exercises-rcna41126"" target=""_blank"">plyometric</a>, component to many workout moves, including squats and lunges. You can also <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/want-lose-weight-try-jump-rope-workout-beginners-t221464"" target=""_blank"">jump rope</a> or just hop in place. Be careful, though, as jumping is a high-impact activity. Here's a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-low-impact-exercise-fitness-test-rcna18170"" target=""_blank"">quick quiz</a> you can take to figure out whether you should do high-impact workouts. </p> <p class="""">Your calf muscles pick your feet up off the ground and propel you forward when you're <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-run-properly-rcna47006"" target=""_blank"">running</a>. To increase the calf strengthening component of your runs, run on an incline — a.k.a. uphill. </p> <p class="""">As with running, the calf muscles push you forward when you <a href=""https://www.today.com/walking-guide"" target=""_blank"">walk</a>. To increase the calf workout you get by walking, walk uphill. If you're <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/hiit-treadmill-workouts-rcna121189"" target=""_blank"">walking on a treadmill</a>, try taking your hands off of the handrails so that your calf muscles have to do more stabilizing work. </p> <p class="""">The thighs do most of the work when you're biking or <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/peloton-cycling-weight-loss-bike-should-be-part-fuller-exercise-t182268"" target=""_blank"">cycling indoors</a>, but the calves do a lot of stabilizing. If you want to make the calves more of a focus, biking up steeper hills or increasing the resistance on your spin bike will make the calves work harder, as will shifting to a more upright position.</p> <p class="""">I’ve put together some of the best calf-targeting exercises you can do at home, without any special equipment needed. Remember to take it slow and build up your repetitions over time if you’re just starting to focus on this muscle group — you can add a few of these moves into your current workout or create a calf-focused circuit with your favorites!</p> <p class="""">Start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. Squeezing your calf muscles, slowly raise your body, lifting your heels until you’re on your toes. Make sure to stand tall and straight. Then lower your heels back to the floor with control. Repeat.</p> <p class="""">Start by standing upright with your legs together and your arms by your sides. With slightly bent knees, jump into the air. As you’re jumping, spread your legs shoulder-width apart, and swing your arms laterally up and over your head. Jump back to the starting position and repeat.</p> <p class="""">Start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart. You’ll be kicking your feet behind you to try and touch your bottom; this will help with <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/hip-flexor-stretches-rcna16322"" target=""_blank"">hip flexor mobility</a> and can also loosen up the quads. Simply kick your right foot back toward your right glute, and then kick your left foot back toward your left glute. The faster you go, the more you may feel like you’re running in place, so make sure you focus the movement on kicking your feet toward your glute with every step.</p> <p class="""">Jump squats are a power move that targets your entire lower body and core. With your feet hip-distance apart, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-do-squats-5-steps-perform-squat-properly-today-t208207"" target=""_blank"">lower into a squat position</a>. Make sure you keep a strong/straight back, and keep your knees behind your toes. With control, jump straight up and swing your arms overhead. Softly return back to your starting position and repeat.</p> <p class="""">Begin this move by standing with your feet wide and your toes pointed slightly outward. With a strong back, engage your core and glutes as you lower into a squat position. Then, press down through your toes to come up and lift your heels. Keep the weight in your toes and you press up to stand. Slowly lower your heels back to the floor and repeat.</p> <p class="""">Begin in <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-do-plank-right-way-without-back-pain-today-t209122"" target=""_blank"">plank position</a>, keeping your back straight, your hips low and your core engaged. Bring your right knee under your chest toward your right elbow. Return your right leg back to plank position; bring your left leg under your chest toward your left elbow. Repeat while alternating your legs, keeping a steady pace. Remember to breathe and concentrate on engaging your abs, glutes and <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-hamstring-exercises-rcna17619"" target=""_blank"">hamstrings</a>.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, pointing your toes slightly outward. Engage your core to keep yourself stable, and slowly lift your heels up off the floor. Make sure you keep your knees straight but soft throughout this movement to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/suffer-knee-or-back-pain-try-these-5-low-impact-t205966"" target=""_blank"">prevent knee injury or pain</a>. Hold briefly at the top, and slowly lower your heels back to the floor. Repeat.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, this time, pointing your toes slightly inward. Engage your core to keep yourself stable, and slowly lift your heels up off the floor. Make sure you keep your knees straight but soft throughout this movement to prevent knee injury or pain. Hold briefly at the top, and slowly lower your heels back to the floor. Repeat.</p> <p class="""">For this move, we’ll begin by performing a traditional calf raise. With a tight core, squeeze your calves as you raise your heels off the ground. Once you reach the top of the motion, pause. Hold here for a deep inhale, followed by a count of 3, and then lower back to the starting position on your exhale. Repeat.</p> <p class="""">For this exercise, we’ll start in an athletic, half-squat stance. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, your hips low, and your knees relaxed/slightly bent. Pushing through the balls of your feet, run in place as quickly as you can, swinging your arms forward and back for stabilization and extra speed. </p> <p class="""">In a standing position with feet hip-distance apart, take a large step backward with your right foot. Next, drive your left hip back as you lower your right knee to the floor without touching it. Then, drive off the right foot to return to the starting position. Repeat, this time stepping backward with the left foot. Continue alternating legs, completing 10 repetitions per leg.</p> <p class="""">Sit on a chair so your feet are comfortably flat on the floor. Raise the heels of your feet as high as you can, coming up onto your toes, then slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions.</p> <p class="""">Start standing with your feet hip-distance apart. Maintaining an upright torso with your core engaged, take an extended step forward with your right foot. Engage your core as you lower down into a lunge position. Bending both knees, lower your back knee to the ground, stopping before touching it. With the weight in your right foot, push back up to a standing position. Repeat on the other leg. Complete 10 repetitions per leg.</p> <p class="""">This exercise will help to improve overall balance and strength in the calves. Rise up to the tips of your toes with both heels off the floor. Walk forward in short steps. Continue for 30 seconds. Rest, then repeat two more times.</p> <p class="""">From a standing position, widen your stance with one foot in front of the other as if you’re going to enter a lunge. As you sink down into the lunge, engage your core muscles as you explode upward. Quickly exchange feet to switch lunge positions when you land. Do your best to land softly. Do not lock your knees. Repeat for 10 repetitions, or 5 repetitions each leg.</p> <p class="""">A variation of a jumping jack, start in the jumping jack position. As you jump, instead of your hands going over your head, they will extend in front of you. Keep your hands at eye level, palms facing each other as they join together. Return to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions.</p> <p class="""">Start standing with feet hips-width apart and arms by your sides. Drive one knee up to a 90-degree angle while engaging your core; pump the opposite arm up to shoulder height. Quickly switch legs to repeat the motion. Stay on the balls of your feet to swiftly transition and engage your calves. Repeat for 20 repetitions, 10 on each leg.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Engage your abs before shifting your weight onto your heels and pulling your toes off the floor. Then rock forward to rise on your toes, heels off the floor. This is one repetition. Repeat for 10 repetitions.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Stephanie Mansour is a contributing health and fitness writer for TODAY.

Here's a look back at some of her milestone moments.</p> <p class="""">In August 2015, Doherty <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/shannen-doherty-reveals-shes-battling-breast-cancer-t39811"" target=""_blank"">went public</a> with her breast cancer diagnosis. As part of her treatment, Doherty underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation and reconstructive surgery.</p> <p class="""">Two years after her initial cancer diagnosis, Doherty revealed that <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/shannen-doherty-announces-remission-breast-cancer-t110957"" target=""_blank"">she was in remission</a>.</p> <p class="""">“Moments.

But in the upcoming Netflix film ""May December,"" he's playing a 36-year-old father of three.</p> <p class="""">Melton, 32, tells TODAY.com he gained ""a little bit more than 30 pounds"" in preparation for his role as Joe Yoo in ""May December,"" which premieres on Dec. 1.</p> <p class="""">""It wasn't so much, 'Joe's gonna look this way,'"" Melton says of his conversations with the film's director, Todd Haynes. ""We just talked about who he was: being a suburban father, 36, has a job, he's the provider, loving husband, three kids.""</p> <p class="""">""There’s really not so much time that he can have for himself where everything else comes before him,"" he continues. ""So we talked about what he would feel like. That work just translated into me making the informed decisions to eat whatever I wanted.""</p> <p class="""">That meant drinking a <em>lot</em> of Fanta, one of his favorite drinks, when he was preparing for the film's 23-day shoot in Savannah, Georgia.</p> <p class="""">""I watched a lot of movies and ate a lot of food,"" Melton jokes. He went through Haynes' master list of inspirations for the film; his favorites were ""Persona"" and ""The Graduate.""</p> <p class="""">In ""May December,"" Melton's character Joe is married to Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore), a woman more than 20 years his senior.  </p> <p class="""">The story deepens when the tabloid-fodder origins of their relationship emerge. 20 years ago, then 36-year-old Gracie was caught having sex with then 13-year-old Joe while working together at a pet store.</p> <p class="""">The couple eventually married and had children (the first of whom were born while Gracie was serving a prison sentence), and now live a relatively quiet life in Savannah, Georgia — until actor Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman) comes to town to research her role playing Gracie in an independent film. Elizabeth forces the couple and their children to look hard at the facts of their family.</p> <p class="""">""(Elizabeth) is almost this catalyst for Joe’s own awakening and acknowledging and coming to terms with his own identity — despite the roles he’s carried for such a long time in his life,"" Melton says. </p> <p class="""">Melton credits the balance — and tension — between Joe, Gracie and Elizabeth to the film's director.</p> <p class="""">""It's incredible, what Todd (Haynes) does, is he sets the table for the audience and you pick and choose what you want from that table,"" he said. ""And we kind of go on this journey through, what we first see from the lens of Natalie's (Portman) character, Elizabeth, but we really are just a fly on the wall of the journey of each of these characters.""</p> <p class="""">As for starring in a film alongside Moore and Portman, two Academy Award winning actors?</p> <p class="""">""I think anybody would be nervous for an opportunity to work with two icons,"" he says. ""But when I first met them, I just completely in awe by how incredible and kind and warm and silly they were, and I felt really supported throughout the whole thing.""</p> <p class="""">Melton is reflecting on how far he's come since his time on ""Riverdale"" ahead of the release of ""May December.</p> <p class="""">""I'm so grateful for 'Riverdale.' I learned so much being on that show for six years, making lifelong friendships, and just learning so much for being on that set for 10 months out of the year for six years,"" he says.</p> <p class="""">""To be able to have the opportunity to work with the legend Todd Haynes and the masters of their craft in Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman,"" he continues. ""I just learned so much and was so excited to stretch as an actor and to really just explore this character based on Samy Burch' script.</p> <p class=""endmark"">He concludes: ""It's bittersweet, I miss so many of those people — so many of my ('Riverdale') co-stars are amazing. We all keep in touch.""</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Anna Kaplan is a news and trending reporter for TODAY.com.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

They’re becoming increasingly verbal and able to answer questions and follow directions. (Or not: There’s a reason people call them “threenagers.”)</p> <p class="""">“Three-year-olds are getting to be more social and have ideas of their own,” said Tovah Klein, director of the Barnard College Center for Toddler Development and author of “How Toddlers Thrive.” According to Klein, “<a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/hot-holiday-toys-2023-t292273"" target=""_blank"">Open-ended toys</a> such as blocks and building toys allow them to explore, discover and carry out their ideas.""</p> <p class="""">They are deep in the “I’ll do it myself” phase, so they enjoy things that help them master the fine motor skills that might help them dress themselves, said Marie Conti, head of The Wetherill School in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, and a board member of the American Montessori Society.</p> <p class="""">From unique gifts for 3-year-olds to <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-stem-toys-t196026"" target=""_blank"">educational toys</a>, we found tons of giftable options for your little one on your wish list.

You can pair this with the wooden ambulance from the same Candycar collection for the perfect gift set for your little one to play pretend.</p> <p class="""">Everyone’s favorite Australian dog and his friends get a kid-friendly bus for transport around Brisbane (or your floor). The Amazon Exclusive set includes all the six characters the bus can seat: Bluey, Bingo, Lila, Coco, Winton and Calypso. All figures can be posed to your tyke's heart's content, so they can make Bluey's imaginary world as realistic as possible.</p> <p class="""">This set of instruments has everything your child needs to start a band — minus the drum set (aren’t you glad?). Your little musician's kit will include a tunable ukulele (available in two colors), a tambourine, a clapper, a rattle and a rainmaker. And not only will this set inspire your 3-year-old's inner musician, but, as the brand claims, it can help develop their auditory sense and ear-hand coordination.</p> <p class="""">This unusual puzzle lets 3-year-olds arrange sticks to form a picture, a different kind of problem solving than the usual notch-and-groove puzzle.</p> <p class="""">“The sandbox is one of the most popular activities on our playground, for all ages,” Conti said. This magic sand is a perfect indoor version. It’s sensory play at its best.</p> <p class="""">They'll develop fine motor skills alongside shape and pattern recognition with this toy drill board. Each set comes with five reversible board cards that they can follow, or they can use their imagination to get creative.</p> <p class="""">The options are endless when it comes to the patterns and designs your child could make with these vibrant geometric blocks, but they can also build the patterns that are already included with the set. Their problem-solving skills and natural curiosity will also be tested by shapes like hexagons, trapezoids, rhombuses and more.</p> <p class="""">With a magnetic stylus, reinforcing the ABCs and their handwriting becomes an easy task. It’s perfect for the young learner who is still practicing their penmanship.</p> <p class="""">Landing on <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/toy-insider-hot-toy-list-2023-rcna103867"" target=""_blank"">The Toy Insider's STEM 10 list</a> this year, budding speedsters can design their own magnetic race track using the kit's translucent pieces, all while exploring development logic skills.</p> <p class="""">With 100 pieces, this wooden block building set is meant for fun and play. They'll get to use the colorful blocks and shapes to build their own architectural creations.</p> <p class="""">Conti is a big fan of wooden magnetic blocks like these for easy manipulation with less frustration. This block set consists of 14 differently shaped pieces made of sustainable (and gorgeous) hardwood, which have playful graphics painted on them with water-based, nontoxic lacquer.</p> <p class="""">Encourage early STEM development and fine motor skills with this interactive gear set that really works. According to the brand, this set will help them start learning about sorting, grouping, counting — and even putting physics into play with the spinning gears!</p> <p class="""">These magnetic tiles allow kids to create their own masterpieces and will captivate them for years to come. “Kids will play with those for hours,” Conti said.</p> <p class="""">Small craft pieces like felt, pipe cleaners and googly eyes encourage creativity and fine motor skills as kids create mini masterpieces.</p> <p class="""">Little ones are unleashing their inner artist at this age, and this set lets them explore through touch and feel.</p> <p class="""">Prepare for hours of music play with this mini guitar that's just right for little fingers. “Musical toys can form a big part of a 3-year-old’s day,” said educational toy expert Lauren Leisk.</p> <p class="""">The marble run behind this kid-friendly easel will let children create different paths for cascading marbles, while the easel can be used as a chalkboard or a white board, with built-in paint cups and a tray for art supplies. With this easel, the brand aims to help your child explore both engineering and art!</p> <p class="""">This toy was designed to inspire hours of screen-free fun. They can change the color of the light in the lantern. Plus, it plays soothing noises like bird chirps, campfire sounds, ocean waves and more to help them feel like they’re on a real adventure.</p> <p class="""">If they're into dinosaurs, they'll love this set that will help them play out all of the Jurassic-style scenarios living in their heads. This set includes 12 realistic dinosaurs of all kinds, as well as their names and fun facts about each, to keep your little archeologist immersed for hours.</p> <p class="""">Like mother, like child! They'll love pretending to roam the aisles with this inspired shopping cart that resembles the one they see their parent carrying during their CVS runs.</p> <p class="""">These real silk play scarves can be capes, wings, the roof of a fortress...it's the ultimate in open-ended play.</p> <p class="""">If Japanese fare is more your child chef's speed, they can now “cut” sushi and then pick them up using (helpfully velcroed) chopsticks, thanks to this sushi ""slicing"" set.</p> <p class="""">Get them loving chores while they're still young. With a working suction and twisting and turning capabilities, this mini Dyson vacuum replica works just like Mom's and Dad's!</p> <p class="""">This fun dragon costume is easy to put on and take off for 3-year-olds who want a quick change — or are quick to change their fancy. Don't let the scales or ""armor"" fool you; this reversible cape is made with a smooth, snuggle velvet, and there's a foolproof, kid-friendly Velcro closure at the neck.</p> <p class="""">Why should tea sets get all the fun? Baby can make their first ""cappuccino"" with this coffee set. With its 20 play pieces that include a ""fill and drop"" filter, as well as signal lights and realistic coffeeshop sounds, your tyke will have fun playing barista while potentially developing their fine motor skills. The drawer below opens to reveal doughnuts and other treats.</p> <p class="""">Kids may hate going to the dentist, but they won't mind <em>playing </em>dentist! Landing on <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/walmart-top-toys-2023-rcna101241"" target=""_blank"">Walmart's Top Toys list</a> this year, the Melissa &amp; Doug pretend play set comes with plenty of accessories to teach them about good oral hygiene.</p> <p class="""">This chic wooden camera features a kaleidoscope lens to delight 3-year-olds as they mimic their paparazzi parents. It's also available with a yellow lens.</p> <p class="""">Whether your three-year-old wants to run the house or help you around the house, this cleaning tools set is the perfect set. With a broom, mop, duster, dustpan and hand brush, the set has all the tools to keep an (imaginative!) house clean and your toddler running around.</p> <p class="""">Flying to store shelves just in time for the new ""Paw Patrol"" movie is set to hit theaters, this plushy Skye is ready for her next rescue adventure in her bright pink uniform with plenty of embroidered details.</p> <p class="""">Make bedtime just a little more exciting by letting little ones draw in glow-in-the-dark ink. In the daytime, this whimsical bear has soft white and yellow fur with shimmering purple details. Your tyke can choose to cuddle or, using the included LED pen, draw all manner of fantastical shapes right on the bear. This activates the fur's glow effect, which, in the dark, illuminates your child's drawings. (Not to worry: They fade away after two minutes, the brand says.)</p> <p class="""">Is the avocado your tyke's latest obsession? Take a gander at this one, which will never brown. This avocado is part of Squishable’s “comfort food” line, an unusual addition to the usual stuffed animal menagerie. It's also the smaller version of the full-size Comfort Food Avocado Squishable, which means that, at 7 inches, it's the perfect size for 3-year-olds to cuddle and play with. ""This is an A+++ squish,"" said one reviewer.</p> <p class="""">This smooshable fox is ready to comfort and play with your preschooler. (In fact, these are made suitable for newborns and up.) You can choose between a 10-inch small or a 12-inch medium fox, whichever your tyke prefers for maximum cuddles.</p> <p class="""">These dolls are huggable, machine-washable and dryer-safe, and each comes with its own pet for extra fun. Harper, the little playdate friend featured here, not only includes a white built-in onesie and adorable bow, but she also sports a cute removable dress and shoes!</p> <p class="""">Elmo has been a holiday staple for as long as we can remember. (Who can forget the Tickle Me Elmo craze of the '90s?!) Appearing on The Toy Insider's annual list of the hottest toys this season is this dancing plush that encourages kids to be active.</p> <p class="""">As they start school, toddlers may become more interested in cozy friends who give comfort. These therapist-designed snugglers come with a story to help with stress management. According to Slumberkins, ""Alpaca teaches children to articulate their feelings, manage their anxiety and share their worries with others.""</p> <p class="""">This bestselling car carrier helps with fine motor skills and imaginative play.</p> <p class="""">The trunk that holds these fire trucks opens up and turns into a building ripe for rescue. Different types of trucks will please the most truck-obsessed preschooler.</p> <p class="""">This John Deere tractor might not help much on the farm, but it will do just about anything a child could want, with lights and sounds for extra appeal.</p> <p class="""">Is your 3-year-old enamored with all forms of transportation? It’s trains, planes and automobiles all in one in this 80-piece set, which also features construction trucks and toys, a fire station and more. We also like that the two-piece storage bucket turns into part of the landscape. Plus, all the pieces can go back in the bucket when you’re done.</p> <p class="""">The mini magnetic fishing rod can ""catch"" the set's three magnetic bobbing characters for endless ""catch and release"" fun.</p> <p class="""">For a more artsy bath experience, your 3-year-old can color in these little pets, then wash them off and start all over again.</p> <p class="""">Every three-year-old has a little scientist in them. Allow them to channel their scientific urges with this water lab bath toy that creates double-chain reactions and effects.</p> <p class="""">If your little one is obsessed with the hit show ""CoComelon,"" they'll love having this JJ doll as their new bathtime companion. He comes with an inflatable floatie, swim trunks and a shark bath squirter, so he's ready for a dip in the tub!</p> <p class="""">“They can fit easily in your tote bag the same way an iPad could,” Conti said of this restickable set. The play set includes 350 vivid reusable pieces, a design guide and a play board. Your 3-year-old will have a blast finding endless combinations, sticking the pieces to the board, any glossy surface or each other!</p> <p class="""">""Bluey is everyone's favorite show, from preschoolers to grade schoolers to parents,"" The Toy Insider's editor-in-chief Marissa Silva says about this popular TV show about the titular Australian Blue Heeler and their equally beloved family. This four-story Hammerbarn shopping center allows the characters (and kids) to explore the environment and curb their curiosity.</p> <p class="""">This Lego set is said to help kids identify emotions and practice collaboration for <a href=""https://www.today.com/parenting-guides/how-support-social-emotional-development-pre-k-t177227"" target=""_blank"">social emotional development</a>, something many parents are concerned about at this stage in their children's lives. How? The bricks not only come in a variety of colors and shapes, but each also has its own facial expression. The set also comes with a teaching activity card that guides parents, as well as eight double-sided character templates.</p> <p class="""">A dollhouse gives toddlers room for creative play, as well as a space to work through issues around separation as they head to school. This one has an open design that lets kids play on all sides, so there’s no elbowing for a spot.</p> <p class="""">As farm animals wait for the sun to rise, it seems to take a little too long. So they set off on a journey to the edge of the world to summon the sunrise. If your little one loves animals great and small, they'll love this tale, which, according to Publisher's Weekly, ""appreciates creatures’ gentle ways and offers a quiet reminder about perceptions’ ability to mislead.""</p> <p class="""">The pigeon first tried to ride the bus nearly 20 years ago. Now he’s ready for a roller coaster and can barely stand the excitement.</p> <p class="""">Finn’s parents just won’t stay in bed at night, so he’ll have to enforce their bedtime routine in this funny role reversal.</p> <p class="""">Banana is waiting for his turn in this (mostly) rhyming fruit-counting book that keeps counting animals instead. This fun counting book will make little ones giggle.</p> <p class="""">Sylvie the spider watches over the tenants where she lives beneath a fire escape. Not since “Charlotte’s Web” has a spider been such a kind friend.</p> <p class="""">Brown is the color of leaves and black a dark puddle in this lyrical exploration of positive associations of black and brown.</p> <p class=""endmark""><em>​​Don’t forget to check out Shop TODAY’s other gift guides to find the </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/best-gifts-kids-age-according-our-2018-gift-guides-t142282"" target=""_blank""><em>perfect present for every kid on your list</em></a><em> including </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-babies-our-2017-holiday-gift-guide-t118481"" target=""_blank""><em>babies</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-1-year-olds-our-2017-holiday-gift-guide-t118615"" target=""_blank""><em>1-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-2-year-olds-our-2017-holiday-guide-t118768"" target=""_blank""><em>2-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-4-year-olds-our-2017-holiday-gift-guide-t118881"" target=""_blank""><em>4-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-5-year-olds-our-2017-holiday-gift-guide-t118882"" target=""_blank""><em>5-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-toys-6-year-olds-according-development-experts-t139235"" target=""_blank""><em>6-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-toys-7-year-olds-our-gift-guide-t139588"" target=""_blank""><em>7-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-toys-8-year-olds-according-development-experts-t139821"" target=""_blank""><em>8-year-olds</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/gifts-9-year-olds-t136452"" target=""_blank""><em>9-year-olds</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/29-best-gifts-10-year-old-boys-girls-2018-t140511"" target=""_blank""><em>10-year-olds</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

A stronger core is important for stability, support in everyday movements, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/posture-exercises-rcna12220"" target=""_blank"">maintaining good posture</a> and reducing back pain.</p> <p class="""">But what makes an effective ab routine? When most people think ab exercises, the first thing that comes to mind is <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-do-a-crunch-rcna26121"" target=""_blank"">crunches</a>. While crunches can be effective if performed correctly, they are easy to get wrong.</p> <p class="""">Many people complain of <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/lower-back-pain-exercises-help-back-neck-pain-t175179"" target=""_blank"">neck or back pain</a> when performing standard exercises like crunches and <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-do-situp-without-straining-your-neck-t219780"" target=""_blank"">situps</a>. The positioning of your hands behind your head presents an opportunity for you to pull on your neck, causing strain and also devaluing the exercise. Plus, it's easy to allow your body to recruit other muscles for help. You really need to have quite a strong core already to properly perform a full situp!</p> <p class="""">The good news is that situps and crunches are just scratching the surface when it comes to moves that target your abdominals. There are lots of effective exercises that <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/monthly-workout-plan-core-rcna26621"" target=""_blank"">strengthen your core. </a>Plus, it’s worthwhile to diversify your workout with different ab exercises to target the core from different angles and create a well-rounded routine that doesn’t get stale.</p> <p class="""">Here are 16 abdominal exercises from personal trainer and TODAY fitness contributor Stephanie Mansour that you can try at home.</p> <p class="""">Mansour likes to start every ab routine with a pelvic tilt. It's a great exercise to wake up your core and practice engaging the proper muscles before jumping into other ab exercises. Lying on your back, bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground. Make sure your feet are open as wide as your hips. Reach your arms down toward your feet. Take a deep breath in and feel your low back arch slightly off of the ground. Then exhale as you tilt your pelvis forward and press your low back into the ground. Pull your naval in toward your spine as if you’re zipping into a tight pair of pants. Release and repeat 10 times.</p> <p class="""">Start on your hands and knees on the mat. Line your shoulders up over your wrists, and make sure your wrists are parallel with the front of the mat. Walk your knees back a few inches. Pull your navel in toward your spine as if there is fire on the mat and you’re trying to pull your stomach away from the fire. Tuck your toes under and lift your legs up off of the ground. Squeeze your quads and reach your heels toward the back of the room. Make sure your shoulders are over your wrists, and that you’re looking a few inches in front of your fingers to keep your head and neck elongated. Hold for 30 seconds.</p> <p class="""">Come into a plank position with your shoulders over your wrists. Pull your naval in toward your spine, and hug your legs together as you bring the left foot to touch the right. Turn onto the right outer edge of the right foot, stacking the left foot on top. Press down through your right hand, keeping it directly underneath your right shoulder, and slowly bring the left hand onto your left hip. Pull the abs in toward the spine and the right hip away from the floor. Extend the left arm straight up to the ceiling, and hold the position for 30-45 seconds before coming through plank and switching sides.</p> <p class="""">Begin in plank position, keeping your back straight, your hips low and your core engaged. Bring your right knee under your chest toward your right elbow. Return your right leg back to plank position; bring your left leg under your chest toward your left elbow. Repeat, alternating your legs and keeping a steady pace. Remember to breathe and concentrate on engaging your abs, glutes and hamstrings.</p> <p class="""">Get on all fours with your palms directly below your shoulders and your knees below your hips. Straighten your left arm straight out in front of you and your right leg out behind you. After that, bend your left elbow and your right knee, crunching your abs, until they touch underneath your stomach. Repeat using your right arm and left leg. Alternate between sides, performing 10 times on each side.</p> <p class="""">Lie on your back with your legs straight up toward the ceiling. Let your arms rest down at your sides. You can also place your hands under your butt for increased stabilization. Squeeze your core and lower both of your legs 6-12 inches down to about a 45-degree angle. Lift one leg up as your lower the other toward the floor. Switch legs. Continue to alternate, moving your legs in a flutter motion. Repeat for about 15 repetitions, and make sure not to speed up as you go.</p> <p class="""">This move works your lower core muscles. Stand with your feet hips-distance apart and your arms at your sides. Place the right hand on the back of the head like you would for a crunch. Begin moving your torso down toward the left, crunching the left oblique, so that your right elbow reaches up toward the sky. Reach your left hand down toward the ground. Hold this position, squeezing the abs, then switch sides.</p> <p class="""">With your knees bent, squeeze your abs and raise your legs so that your knees are hovering over your hips at a 90-degree angle. Keep your calves parallel to the mat so that your legs are in a table-top position. Engage your core as you lift your hips and knees toward your chest. Think of tilting your pelvis forward. Keep your entire upper body on the ground. Make sure that only the lowest part of your back comes off the ground; nothing higher. Keep the legs in a 90-degree angle throughout the entire movement as you come back down, through table top, and tap the feet on the ground. Repeat the steps, remembering to breathe slowly while squeezing your abdominals.</p> <p class="""">Lie on your back with your arms straight out at your sides forming a ""T"" shape with your body. Lift your legs off the ground and bend them into a tabletop position with the shins parallel to the floor. From this position, slowly lower your legs to the right hovering a few inches off of the floor, using your abs to control the movement. When your knees get close to the floor, reverse the movement of your legs, moving them back through center and down to the left side of your body. Repeat, moving side to side for a total of 20 reps (10 on each side).</p> <p class="""">Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet either hovering above the floor or resting on the ground. Tilt your upper body backward to a 45-degree angle (this will feel like you are at the top position of a situp). Hold a dumbbell in both hands, squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull your shoulders away from your ears. Keeping the dumbbell in front of your chest, twist your torso to the right, tapping the dumbbell on the floor, then move back through center and twist to the left, tapping the dumbbell on the floor. Repeat 5 times on each side. For a modification, perform the move without a dumbbell.</p> <p class="""">Lying down on your back, reach your legs straight up so your feet are reaching toward the ceiling. For a modification, you can slightly bend your knees. As you exhale, tighten your upper abs and curl your head, neck and chest off the ground as you reach your arms toward your toes. Repeat 20 times.</p> <p class="""">Seated on a mat, engage your core muscles and gently lean back a couple of inches. Slowly lift your legs up in the air so that are in a table-top position. Reach your arms straight out in front of you so that they are parallel with the mat. Keeping your core engaged, extend the legs straight up to a 45-degree angle, forming a “V” shape with your body. If you feel balanced here, attempt reaching your arms up toward the ceiling. You always have the option to leave them straight out in front of you. Hold this position for 10 seconds. Keep the shoulders relaxed, abs pulled in and the inner thighs squeezing together. Release your legs and arms down to the starting position.</p> <p class="""">Sit up with your back straight and your knees bent with your feet flat on the ground. Lightly grab your ankles and lift your legs into the air, pointing your toes toward the ceiling, so that your body forms a ""V"" shape. Remember to keep your legs open as wide as your hips. Roll backward onto your shoulder blades, keeping your core engaged. Roll back up and straighten your back while keeping your legs straight up and open. Repeat, rolling back and forth, pausing at the top every time.</p> <p class="""">Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground as wide as your hips. With your hands behind your head and your elbows bent out to the sides, use your abs to lift your left shoulder blade off the ground. At the same time, bring your right knee to meet your left elbow. When your right knee is bent, straighten your left leg and reach it out in front of you at a 45-degree angle. Perform on the opposite side, bringing your left knee to your right elbow, straightening the right leg. Continue alternating legs and squeeze your core. Brush your inner thighs together as you switch sides to ensure you’re hugging your legs in towards the midline of your body.</p> <p class="""">Lie on the floor with your arms at your sides and your legs straight out in front of you. Make sure to keep your low back on the ground as you pull your naval in towards the spine and squeeze your legs together. With your legs straight and together, lift into the air so that your body creates an L shape. Slowly lower your legs toward the mat without arching your back. Once your feet are hovering above the ground, hold for a few seconds before returning to the first step.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Performing crunches while standing will help you <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/lower-back-pain-exercises-help-back-neck-pain-t175179"" target=""_blank"">avoid the back and neck discomfort</a> that can be experienced when performing the traditional crunch. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and squeeze your abdominals, bringing your belly button toward your spine and your hips forward. Place your hands behind your head and perform a crunch, bringing your shoulder and head down toward the floor. Be sure to maintain the space between your chin and chest, and keep your elbows out to the sides to avoid pulling your neck. Reverse the move, returning back to an upright standing position. Repeat 10 times.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Brianna Steinhilber is an editor and writer on TODAY Health, Food, TMRW and NBC News BETTER.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

It typically starts out as a cough, which usually doesn't respond to typical treatment. Some dogs end up with a chronic cough for weeks to months, breathing difficulties or severe pneumonia, which can lead to death in as little as two or three days, Dr. Renee McDougall, specialty surgeon and director of medical programs at <a href=""https://bondvet.com/"" target=""_blank"">Bond Vet</a>, tells <a href=""http://today.com/"" target=""_blank"">TODAY.com</a>.</p> <p class="""">While the initial symptoms of the mystery illness may seem like kennel cough — which is caused by a variety of known bacteria and viruses, and usually clears up on its own after a week or so — dogs with the mystery illness test negative for the common causes of respiratory illness, and their coughs tend to last much longer.</p> <p class="""">What's more, the cause of this mystery illness is unknown. Scientists are still trying to pin down whether the infectious agent is a virus or bacteria, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.</p> <p class="""">As researchers investigate the illness, which has been reported in at least 14 states, veterinarians are urging pet owners to take precautions, look out for symptoms — especially coughing — and contact their vet if anything seems off.</p> <p class="""">Amid the mystery illness outbreak in dogs, the AVMA is urging owners to monitor their dogs for progressive coughing that may be accompanied nasal or eye discharge and sneezing.</p> <p class="""">But identifying a dog cough can be harder than you may think, says Dr. Michele Forbes, owner of Compassionate Care Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p> <p class="""">In a now-viral TikTok video, Forbes explained that canine coughing is often overlooked in the early stages or mistaken for something else: “Rarely do (dog owners) identify a cough until it becomes an overt problem and it’s clearly coming from the chest,” Forbes, who goes by <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@drforbeez"" target=""_blank"">@drforbeez on TikTok</a>, said in the video.</p> <p class="""">“Dogs have been coughing forever, and they cough for a variety of reasons. It’s not always infectious. But in my experience, pet parents often don’t know what a cough looks (or sounds) like,” Forbes tells TODAY.com, adding that this can delay care. </p> <p class="""">Forbes says she posted the video — along with clips of different types of dog coughs — to increase awareness.</p> <p class="""">“We’re catching (the mystery illness) way too late, and some of the less (symptomatic) dogs are spreading it because the owners don’t even know that their dog is coughing and take them out,” she says.</p> <p class="""">Similar to kennel cough, the mystery illness may start as a dry, hacking cough.</p> <p class="""">""Think about when your dog is walking on the leash and pulling at the end. The sound they make when they are choking is kind of a classic coughing sound,"" McDougall explains.</p> <p class="""">Some dogs may produce a honking sound, similar to a goose.</p> <p class="""">However, it's also common for a cough to sound like the dog is gagging or clearing the throat, says Forbes. ""(Owners) will always report it as, 'My dog is choking,' or, 'My dog has something stuck in his throat,'"" she notes.</p> <p class="""">Owners might also notice their dog's chest heaving and abdomen moving as it coughs. “It may look like a hairball trying to come up, and sometimes they actually do bring up foam or a little bit of white liquid,” says McDougall. </p> <p class="""">Dogs with a wet cough, which produces phlegm, may make a gargling sound as they hack up mucus.</p> <p class="""">Severe coughing episodes can also result in a dog retching and throwing up some bile or food, which owners may confuse with vomiting caused by gastrointestinal issues, Dr. Lindsey Ganzer, veterinarian and CEO at North Springs Veterinary Referral Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, tells TODAY.com. </p> <p class="""">A phenomenon known as reverse-sneezing may also be mistaken for a cough, Ganzer says. This occurs when the dog forcefully sucks in air backwards into their nose rather than coughing outward. Reverse sneezing is often caused by irritants or allergens, and in most cases, it’s nothing to worry about, the experts note. However, if reverse sneezing is accompanied by coughing or nasal discharge, it may be time to call the vet, says Forbes.</p> <p class="""">A cough doesn't always have to be infectious or a sign of illness, the experts note. “If it's something your dog always does on an infrequent and intermittent basis, that can be normal,” says Forbes.</p> <p class="""">If your dog is coughing, ""look at the pattern, the frequency, and the trend,"" says Forbes. In other words, watch for changes in the timing of your dog's coughs, how often it's coughing and whether it's getting worse or better over time.</p> <p class="""">“What we’re looking for is: Is this a dog who maybe did this once or twice a month and is now doing it three to four times a day? That would be concerning,” Forbes adds.</p> <p class="""">If the coughing is not getting better after about a week or so, that may also be a sign of an underlying problem, according to the experts.</p> <p class="""">Another warning sign is if the cough is accompanied by other symptoms of respiratory illness, such as sneezing, nasal or eye discharge, and lack of appetite. This mystery illness also has lethargy and fever as common early symptoms, Forbes says. </p> <p class="""">Bottom line: Owners can typically tell if something is off with their dogs, the experts note. “It all goes back to knowing your dog’s normal and paying attention to changes,” says Forbes.</p> <p class="""">If your dog is coughing, contact your veterinarian right away. It's also helpful for owners to take videos of their dog coughing to show their vet, the experts say.</p> <p class="""">You should also keep an eye out for whether your dog's coughing is paired with any other common symptoms of the mystery canine illness. These include:</p> <p class="""">If your dog is coughing, McDougall recommends asking your vet for any available testing to help assess what may be causing the cough and inform treatment going forward. (For dogs with the mystery illness, basic tests will come back negative.)</p> <p class="""">If you have a healthy dog at home, experts recommend keeping it away from other dogs if you can, especially those who seem sick. ""Avoid high-traffic dog including boarding, doggy day cares, dog parks, grooming or training classes,"" says Ganzer. </p> <p class=""endmark"">Dogs should also stay up to date with their vaccines for other illnesses, the experts note.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Caroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

When your toddler builds the farm animal band, they will receive a variety of play from the 10 special sensory blocks (which make percussion sounds) to create their own musical notes. These blocks are compatible with other Mega Bloks toys for more fun. </p> <p class="""">Your preschooler is ready for pretend play, suggests Oppenheim. ""Giving them props for pretend is a great way to expand their language and ability to spin a story."" Take this pizza oven set, for instance. With velcro attachments to connect each listen together to a pizza oven with a clicking dial, this toy is a clever way for them to host their own pretend pizza party. </p> <p class="""">There's a reason these Magna-Tiles are one of the most popular toys this year. And now, your child will enjoy the brand's new racing set that comes with two racing cars, drivers and tiles to create tracks for endless racing fun. To create the downhill ramp, they'll need to stack the tiles and follow with the four included ramps. If they want to create a longer racing track, Magna-Tiles offer additional tracks separately. </p> <p class="""">This set brings the popular caterpillar story to life with three foam picture boards of the caterpillar. Each photo has precut holes that are meant to be filled with the included colorful pom poms and are designed to ignite your little one's imagination without the glue or mess. It even comes with a storage bag for swift clean ups. </p> <p class="""">Here's another option for mess-free art. This set comes with translucent stickers and seven suncatchers to transform your home windows into your child's masterpiece. Since the stickers are translucent, they're able to stack on top of each other to teach them all about color mixing. The suncatchers are able to attach to the window with the included suction cup. </p> <p class="""">This will be a treat for your little one (and family pet!) to make. The kit comes with a stainless steel dish, five wood dish panels, paint and other supplies for them to get creative. This set also teaches your little one how to take care of the pet dish, along with painting tips and tricks. </p> <p class="""">This is one of Oppenheim's favorite toys out of all the winners, solely because it can be constructed and enjoyed by all age groups. That includes parents, too! The Air Toobz comes with a motor that blows air into the direction you set the tubes in, teaching your little one the science of physics and engineering. There are 20 foam balls that are included, but parents can buy additional tubes and balls for more loops, tunnels and swirls for them to create. </p> <p class="""">Oppenheim says this game will be enjoyed by early school age kids and preschoolers alike. ""Since this is designed for younger children, they need only to find and point to the object found,"" she mentions. Children will be looking for common objects or their descriptors, such as if something is a specific color, shape, size and material. ""In other words, this is a game that expands language and thinking with cards,"" says Oppenheim.</p> <p class="""">This puzzle can be pieced together again and again to create a new image each time. You can capture a photo of a friend, yourself or any image of your choosing, and the app translates the picture into a code. The puzzle comes with 300 pieces that each come with a designated number and color for you or them to follow. Stick Together offers these puzzles in a single pack (like the one above), two pack, four pack and six pack for everyone to get their hands on. </p> <p class="""">Kids will enjoy a friendly game of racing and stunts with this Hot Wheels racing tower by Little People. In addition to the two racing tracks, kids can launch their cars through a 360-degree loop track, or the daring ""ring of fire,"" and drive through the pretend gas station to refuel for the next race.</p> <p class="""">At over two feet long, this monster truck really lives up to its name. According to the brand, this remote control car can be managed from up to 250 feet away and features oversized tires to rollover any obstacle with ease. The brand also mentions this mega truck is lightweight, making it suitable for indoor play too.</p> <p class="""">Claudie Wells is the newest addition to the American Girl historic doll collection; her story is based on growing up during the 1920's Harlem Renaissance. According to the brand, Claudie comes dressed in a 1920's-inspired outfit and her own book, ""Meet Claudie,"" where kids can read and learn all about her special story. If you'd like to dress up Claudie, you can purchase her <a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=96128X1550925&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americangirl.com%2Fproducts%2Fclaudies-accessories-hjp98&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fshop%2F197155holidaytoys"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">accessories</a> separately. And if you're in the market for more than one of the American Girl historic dolls, you can choose another prominent figures from their<a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=96128X1550925&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americangirl.com%2Fpages%2Fhistorical-characters&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fshop%2F197155holidaytoys"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank""> ten other options</a>.</p> <p class="""">You're probably familiar with counting sheep, but have you ever launched sheep? To play this family-friendly game, the first one to launch all of your sheep into the field wins. Oppenheim loves recommending games to promote family time and says kids will want to play this one again and again.</p> <p class="""">Coming with 49-pieces, this floor puzzle builds a festive three-foot Christmas tree. According to the brand, this activity allows children to explore motor and problem-solving skills, and comes with pieces large enough to make placing and grabbing easy for those tiny hands.</p> <p data-testid=""listicle__description"" class=""listicle-product__description"">Creatures and creations of all kinds come to life with this glowing set. </p> <p class="""">These aren't just your ordinary set of Crayola markers, they glow-in-the-dark to give your child an all new coloring experience. The kit comes with five markers, five deep sea themed coloring pages and two blank pages. Oppenheim even calls it the ""coolest art supplies ever.""</p> <p data-testid=""listicle__description"" class=""listicle-product__description"">Forget paint-by-numbers! This kit lets them create with a little bit of bling. </p> <p class="""">Oppenheim says this gem painting light was a huge hit with their testers and she finds that school-age kids love projects that they can both work on and enjoy. With this craft set, kids can decorate their very own nightlight with sparkly gems to create planets and stars. After, they can see their work shine as it illuminates their bedroom walls.</p> <p class="""">Oppenheim says this magnet paint set is a fun holiday project for kids to gift or keep for themselves once they finish. Coming with 10 holiday themed magnets and 12 acrylic paint pots, kids can mix-and-match and personalize each wooden magnet to their choosing.</p> <p class="""">Babies who are starting to sit up on their own and toddlers alike will love this new robot from Fisher-Price. It is composed of three separate sections that can be combined to form the full robot or taken apart and played with separately to encourage interactive play. From the googly eyes to the mini ball game, it's sure to be a hit.</p> <p class="""">Gift them their first hugger this year, plus an adorable included little pet. These plush dolls have options for both boys and girls and are also machine washable. Plus, the outfits are removable and interchangeable.</p> <p class="""">Parents of Paw Patrol fans know how big of a hit this toy will be. This three-foot tower is a replica of the tower from Adventure City and includes a command center, pup elevator, lights, sounds and everything else they'll need to create adventures of their own. Since it is so big, they can let their imagination run wild while playing with friends or family this year.</p> <p class="""">The future paleontologist of the family will love getting to excavate dinosaur eggs — and then discovering what's inside. After soaking the eggs in water, they can get to work with the chisel and hammer to unearth the dinosaur inside (each kit includes a T-Rex, Triceratops and Stegosaurus). Once they're done, the included mat makes for an easy cleanup.</p> <p class="""">Didn't adopt a pandemic puppy? Moji is just as lovable, but doesn't require any housebreaking or grooming. Once you say her name, you'll watch her come to life; she'll listen to voice commands such as ""sit"" and ""shake."" An included deck of cards can be used to activate additional tricks, such as eating a treat, taking a bath and more.</p> <p class="""">This gadget makes for a great holiday craft. With it, kids can decorate a number of different ornaments with the colors and patterns they choose. After placing an ornament in the decorator, it will spin, and it only takes the touch of a marker to watch the designs come to life. Each set includes the decorating machine, three ornaments and eight markers, so additional ornaments will need to be purchased for future holiday seasons.</p> <p class="""">For a fun STEM activity, kids will love using this ""magic"" kaleidoscope. They'll learn how to construct a kaleidoscope and about light refractions as they piece it together. Kids ages 6 and older can create tons of cool scenes with the included swirl gel, glow-in-the-dark stickers, confetti assortment and more tools.</p> <p class="""">Puzzles soared in popularity in 2020, but they're not going anywhere. This kit allows them to get crafty, as they'll transform a black and white canvas into a colorful jungle scene — once they put all the pieces together, of course. The kit includes 24 washable markers, 100 puzzle pieces and a complete guide to help them along the way.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Oppenheim called this toy the toy of the future. It's a real 3D printer that kids will have a lot of fun using, with a bit of parental supervision (it uses heat to construct designs). It's easy to assemble and is controlled through an app on their phone, as they'll need to scroll through the catalogue in order to select a design. It requires a bit of patience, but the cool designs it can produce — such as the Scooby Doo Mystery Van — are worth every minute.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Emma Stessman is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Jillian Ortiz is a Production Associate at Shop TODAY. </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Shannon Garlin is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Madison San Miguel is the Editorial Assistant for Shop TODAY.

Need help keeping track of all the action? Here's a look back at all the festive fun. </p> <p class="""">At the<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/virgin-river-season-5-part-1-ending-explained-rcna103539"" target=""_blank""> end of Season Five Part One,</a> Mel’s (Alexandra Breckenridge) sister Joey (Jenny Cooper) stumbled upon some love letters that their late mother had written to a man from Virgin River while they were having an affair. The season ended on a cliffhanger as viewers (and Mel) wondered if this mystery man could be Mel’s biological father. </p> <p class="""">In the holiday episodes, Joey comes to town and brings the love letters with her. After a little investigating, Mel discovers the name of the man and pays him a visit on Christmas Eve. He initially denies being her father, but she tells Jack that she knows it’s him. </p> <p class="""">On Christmas, the man visits Mel at her house and admits that he is indeed her biological father. He explains that it broke his heart to see her because she looks so much like her late mother. Mel's father is ready to talk to her now, however, and he brings some of the love letters her mother wrote him. </p> <p class="""">Unfortunately, their happy reunion is short-lived because he says he has something “important” to tell her.</p> <p class="""">“Virgin River” fans have been wondering how Charmaine (Lauren Hammersley) <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/virgin-river-mel-charmaine-pregnant-due-dates-timeline-rcna39775"" target=""_blank"">has been pregnant for five seasons,</a> and she also references the ongoing joke in the holiday episodes. </p> <p class="""">""I feel like I've been pregnant for years,"" she teases while talking with <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/who-shot-jack-virgin-river-season-4-spoilers-rcna39313"" target=""_blank"">Jack (Martin Henderson)</a><strong> </strong>and Mel.</p> <p class="""">Charmaine and Mel haven’t always been on the best of terms, but they seem to have put their differences aside and we learn that Mel is now her midwife. </p> <p class="""">The expectant mother experiences <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/braxton-hicks-pregnant-women-s-questions-about-contractions-t180129"" target=""_blank"">Braxton Hicks contractions</a> and calls Mel, who encourages her to head to the clinic. Charmaine arrives with an unexpected guest, Calvin (David Cubitt). Mel is shocked to hear that he’s the twins’ father. </p> <p class="""">It turns out that Calvin cornered Charmaine by her car and her contractions got worse (naturally), so he drove her over to the clinic. Mel can tell that Charmaine is uneasy around Calvin and asks him to leave. </p> <p class="""">Once he’s gone, the mother-to-be explains that she was angry at Jack when she got together with Calvin. She then reveals that the FBI dropped all charges against him since he helped them catch Melissa (Barbara Pollard). When Melissa tried to kill Calvin, the FBI put him into the witness protection program.</p> <p class="""">Charmaine wasn’t expecting to deliver her babies on Christmas Eve, but they’re eager to meet their mom and she goes into labor. Things are scary for a little while when Charmaine's blood pressure rises, but she eventually delivers two healthy boys. </p> <p class="""">Things were hot and heavy between Preacher (Colin Lawrence) and Kaia (Kandyse McClure) by the end of Season Five Part One. </p> <p class="""">In the holiday episodes, their romance only grows stronger and Preacher accidentally lets it slip that he loves Kaia during one of their dates. She's flattered, but warns him that she can't promise anything to anyone just yet given her recent breakup with her husband.</p> <p class="""">By the end of the second episode, however, Kaia makes it clear that she's committed to Preacher by taking a job as Virgin River's new fire chief. </p> <p class="""">Preacher's happiness is mixed with worry as he learns that the police have identified the body of Wes (Steve Bacic), whom he previously buried. </p> <p class="""">Following his breakup with Brie, Brady found romance with Lark (Elise Gatien)<strong> </strong>and they cozy up over the holidays. Unfortunately, their growing bond isn't all that innocent after all. </p> <p class="""">On Christmas Day, Lark gets a call from Jimmy (Ian Tracey), Calvin's right-hand man<strong> </strong>who is in prison. He asks how ""our little girl"" is doing, referring to her daughter, and viewers are left to wonder if Jimmy is Lark's daughter's father or grandfather. </p> <p class="""">Jimmy asks how Brady is and Lark says he doesn't suspect a thing, leaving viewers to wonder what kind of scheme these two are running. </p> <p class="""">Doc (Tim Matheson) and Hope (Annette O’Toole) are thrilled that <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/denny-cutler-secrets-virgin-river-season-4-explained-rcna39774"" target=""_blank"">Denny (Kai Bradbury)</a> and Lizzie (Sarah Dugdale) are expecting a baby, but Lizzie worries that her own mother won't be so happy to hear the news when she visits over Christmas. Lizzie avoids telling her but she finds out accidentally and isn't exactly supportive at first. </p> <p class="""">Luckily, they sort things out and her mom has one request: that she get a cooler name than ""grandma."" Lizzie obliges her wish and gifts her a ""Glamma"" sweatshirt on Christmas.</p> <p class="""">The expectant parents also reveal some exciting news: they're expecting a baby girl!</p> <p class="""">While attending a town fair, Doc pulls off a surprise proposal and asks Hope to renew their wedding vows. Everyone's around to see it and feel the holiday cheer together. </p> <p class="""">They're not the only couple that's headed for the altar, of course. Mel and Jack are engaged and Mel asks Doc if he'll walk her down the aisle. He gladly accepts the request. </p> <p class="""">After going public with their relationship in the Season Five, Part One finale, Cameron (Mark Ghanime) and Muriel (Teryl Rothery) are still going strong in the holiday episodes. They perform together during a holiday show and Cameron gets a surprise visit from his ex-girlfriend, who is newly sober and wants to get back together. </p> <p class="""">The doctor tells Muriel about the unexpected encounter and explains that he turned down his ex. Muriel is quick to point out that she doesn't want children and wants to give Cameron the chance to back out of their relationship if that's important to him. However, he says she's enough for him. </p> <p class=""endmark"">Later in the episode, Muriel brings up children again and says she doesn't want Cameron to resent her one day if he's unable to become a father.

Kim said Kourtney's romance with Travis Barker changed her so much that her friends and family have a <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/kim-kourtney-kardashian-kids-friends-complain-group-chat-feud-rcna117816"" target=""_blank"">group chat devoted to discussing Kourtney Kardashian</a> called “Not Kourtney.”</p> <p class="""">When it was revealed that Kourtney’s family <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/kourtney-kardashian-not-kourtney-group-chat-rcna118208"" target=""_blank"">had a separate group chat </a>to discuss her, some viewers were not happy. </p> <p class="""">“Totally on Kourtney’s side!!!

For some reason that takes a priority in this family over setting a boundary or taking, having someone’s back.”</p> <p class="""">She further elaborated in her one-on-one interview that her family tends to ""normalize"" some of their exes' behaviors. Kourtney explained that she wants to set a better example for Penelope, who also isn't Tristan's biggest fan. </p> <p class="""">“Everyone can tend to normalize these behaviors of some of the men in our lives and I don’t want to show my daughter that’s OK,” she said. “Having regret and giving grace I think is right, but also having really clear boundaries, I think, is really important.”</p> <p class="""">The show's Instagram post featuring Kourtney and Tristan's exchange was posted following the show, with many people being Team Kourtney.</p> <p class="""">""This is the kourtney we live for,"" one person commented, while another added, ""Kourtney is the only real and honest one about Tristan.

But “Home at Last” takes a different approach: In every episode, it repeats the same timeline but highlights different spaces, slowly unveiling the finished product like a puzzle, piece by piece.</p> <p class="""">In the first episode, for example, France and his husband, Rob France, meet with design and construction firm The Fox Group in September 2022 to talk primary bedroom and bathroom. They then do a walkthrough of the framing in February, and three months later, the drywall is up and interior touches for those specific rooms begin. Come November, the rooms are revealed in full. </p> <p class="""">The style expert tells TODAY.com that family — especially the couple’s kids, Ismail, 2, and 6-month-old Isaac — is the very foundation the whole house is built on.</p> <p class="""">""The plan was always to create a home that our kids could be comfortable in and happy in,"" France says in an interview with TODAY.com, explaining that his two sons were considered ""at every turn"" of the design process. </p> <p class="""">The ""Next in Fashion"" host says they made sure to add personal touches to make the house a home for their kids, like a custom-built nightlight box depicting a scene inspired by one of Ismail's favorite books, ""Goodnight Moon."" </p> <p class="""">""The first few months of (Ismail's) life, he used to get excited when we'd read 'Goodnight Moon' to him ... So we thought, 'Well, what if we could incorporate kind of like a 'Goodnight Moon' (into our home)?'"" France recalls. </p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">""The plan was always to create a home that our kids could be comfortable in and happy in."" 
</p> <p class="""">""Before we put (our sons) down (for bed), my eldest — my <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/tan-france-announces-birth-baby-no-2-see-sweet-pic-find-name-rcna86959"" target=""_blank"">youngest son</a> is too young — will go and lay down on the floor and say goodnight to the mice, and it's just gorgeous,"" he continues.</p> <p class="""">But France explains that the nightlight had more meaning for him than just ""throw this into the wall and an outlet and call it good"" — it's part of his desire to create traditions as a family. </p> <p class="""">""I wanted little traditions with my kids for a lot of things that we did together,"" he says. ""I love my parents so much, but they worked so much that we just didn't get to spend much time with them as kids.""</p> <p class="""">France says his family didn't move around very often and looks back fondly on his childhood home in the U.K. He wants to give his two children that same positive, grounding experience.</p> <p class="""">To this day, the design expert remains close to his family, who are very supportive of his success. France even incorporated a design detail into their new home that his sister wished they had growing up.</p> <p class="""">""My sister always wanted a bay window with a window seat, but they're usually found in nicer homes that we could never have afforded,"" France explains. ""With this house, I created a window at the front of the house with a window seat that I call her window. That makes it feel like my family is still with me even though they're still so far away."" </p> <p class="""">The bay window quickly became part of a morning tradition he shares with his husband and sons.</p> <p class="""">""Every day, we spend time in that little nook, me, my two kids and my husband. We watch the sunrise in the morning. The kids wake up exceptionally early to watch the sunrise together; I feed my youngest in that space,"" France says. </p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">... the dream is to still give this up to our children, and for them to have one home they remember for the rest of their lives and think, 'That's where we were raised.'"" </p> <p class="""">Other family-centric elements will be featured throughout episodes in ""Home at Last,"" like a spice kitchen that is a nod to both his South Asian culture and family. </p> <p class="""">France says creating a sense of home through traditions and familiar details has been crucial to helping Ismail adjust to their new home after leaving the only one he's ever known. France and his husband sold that property a few weeks ago. </p> <p class="""">""The hardest part of this move has been explaining to Ismail (that he has a new home), because for the first couple of days, he kept talking about home. He just wanted to go home,"" France recalls, saying that the couple cried the first few nights because it was ""so upsetting."" </p> <p class="""">France says they made sure to keep Ismail's room looking the exact same way so it would be familiar to him, and after a short while, he no longer asked to go home. France says he's now ""so entertained"" in the new spaces. </p> <p class="""">The couple hopes to give the new property, which France calls their ""dream home,"" to their two sons one day. </p> <p class="""">""Our new version of a dream home is this, but it's a secure home. It's a home that feels cozy, inviting, but the dream is to still give this up to our children, and for them to have one home they remember for the rest of their lives and think, 'That's where we were raised.'"" </p> <p class="""">Until then, though, he wants to share the spaces in ""Home at Last,"" a collaboration with Architectural Digest that originated when France wanted to document his unique project of building an English Tudor-style home with South Asian-inspired details in Utah.</p> <p class="""">""I do love that we're offering a different version — or a different view — of America than we typically see in fancy magazines,"" France explains.</p> <p class=""endmark"">""Home at Last"" premieres at 11 a.m. ET on Nov. 30. Episodes will air every Thursday at 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. ET, and will be replayed on Tuesdays at 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. ET.

According to the logline, “‘The Student’ is an exploration of power and ambition set in a world of corruption and deceit. It’s a mentor-protege story that charts the origins of an American dynasty. Filled with larger than life characters, it reveals the moral and human cost of a culture defined by winners and losers.”</p> <p class="""">Gabriel Sherman, author of “The Loudest Voice in the Room: How the Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News — and Divided a Country,” will write the film about Trump. His novel inspired the Showtime miniseries “The Loudest Voice,” which starred Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes. “The Student” is a co-production between Daniel Beckerman of Scythia Films, Jacob Jerek of Profile Pictures and Ruth Treacy of Taylored Films. Executive Producers are Grant Johnson, Gabriel Sherman and Amy Baer.</p> <p class="""">This year, Stan received Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for his portrayal of rocker Tommy Lee in Hulu’s biographical drama “Pam &amp; Tommy.” He’s most well known for his Marvel Cinematic Universe role as Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier. His most recent appearance as the hero came on the Disney+ series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” and he’s next due to star in “The Thunderbolts” in 2025. Stan also played Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev in this fall’s GameStop stock movie “Dumb Money,” and his recent roles include “Ghosted,” “Sharper,” “Bupkis,” “Fresh” and “The 355.”</p> <p class="""">Abbasi’s most recent film “Holy Spider” was selected as Denmark’s entry for best international feature film at this year’s Academy Awards. The film, about a journalist investigating a serial killer in Iran, also competed for the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and won the best actress award for Zar Amir Ebrahimi. Abbasi also directed two episodes of HBO’s “The Last of Us.”</p> <p class="""">Stan is repped by CAA, Brookside Artist Management, and Sloane, Offer, Weber &amp; Dern; Abbasi by CAA, LARK in the U.K., and Entertainment 360; and Sherman by Entertainment 360.

He was secretary of state and national security adviser under two Republican presidents, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, and advised powerful leaders in both American political parties for decades.</p> <p class="""">He came to be seen as one of the leading diplomats and international relations intellectuals of the 20th century, an exponent of “realpolitik” who orchestrated the normalization of relations with China and helped ease tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p> <p class="""">Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the settlement that ended the Vietnam War, jointly receiving the award with Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam, who refused the honor. Kissinger helped open diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China during the Nixon administration in the early 1970s.</p> <p class="""">But he was also one of the most singularly reviled public figures of his age, one whose legacy is inextricably bound up with bloodshed around the world. In the eyes of his critics, he was synonymous with the brutality of American power and some of the costliest foreign policy decisions in modern history.</p> <p class="""">Kissinger’s detractors denounced him for the central part he played in expanding U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, bringing a wide-scale bombing campaign to Cambodia and supporting brutal regimes in Argentina, Chile, Indonesia and Pakistan.

The end of the video sees Carpenter in a Catholic church — and that detail has dominated headlines ever since.</p> <p class="""">In the ""Feather"" music video, the singer can be seen dancing inside Our Lady of Mount Carmel-Annunciation Church, located in the neighborhood of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, surrounded by colorful coffins standing upright.

It has been shown time and time again to have numerous physical and mental health benefits — from boosting metabolism to improving blood pressure and maintaining mobility and many more.</p> <p class="""">Walking is accessible, low-impact and easy to work into your everyday routine. It's also generally very safe for most people and has a lower risk of injuries or overdoing it compared to other forms of more intense exercise.</p> <p class="""">There's also strong evidence that <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/physical-mental-benefits-walking-t207904"" target=""_blank"">walking can lower your risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and Type 2 diabetes</a>. Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent and expensive chronic diseases in the United States.</p> <p class="""">38 million or 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and approximately 90 to 95% of them have Type 2 diabetes, according to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics-report/index.html"" target=""_blank"">the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. 97 million Americans have prediabetes — that's about 30% of the U.S. population.</p> <p class="""">Physical activity is an important part of managing and preventing diabetes. Studies have shown that walking after meals can help keep your blood sugar steady, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-blood-sugar-level-rcna41995"" target=""_blank"">TODAY.com previously reported</a>, and working walking into your daily routine can help with managing weight.</p> <p class="""">That's why the <a href=""https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/fitness/diabetes-walking-plan"" target=""_blank"">American Diabetes Association</a> recommends walking 10,000 steps every day or for at least 30 minutes daily. But it begs the question, does speed matter? How fast do you need to walk in order to lower your risk of type 2 diabetes? Does walking faster make a difference?</p> <p class="""">Research has shown that more time spent walking per day is associated with a lower diabetes risk, and it's known that walking at a faster pace can help improve those benefits,<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fast-walk-lower-diabetes-risk-rcna126796"" target=""_blank"">NBC News reported</a>. However, it wasn't previously clear what speed people should aim for, up until now.</p> <p class="""">Finally, researchers have come up with an ideal walking pace for lowering diabetes risk. A new analysis shows that walking at least 2.5 miles per hour can significantly cut your risk of Type 2 diabetes.</p> <p class="""">The findings, published this week in the <a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/11/14/bjsports-2023-107336"" target=""_blank"">British Journal of Sports Medicine</a>, show that the risk of Type 2 diabetes decreased significantly at a walking speed of 4 km/h or 2.5 mph and above. </p> <p class="""">In the study, walking speeds were defined as the following:</p> <p class="""">Researchers analyzed 10 studies conducted between 1999 and 2022 exploring the association between walking speed and the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes among adults. The studies included participants from the U.S., Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p> <p class="""">The findings showed that once people reach the minimum speed of 2.5 mph, their Type 2 diabetes risk continues to drop as they increase their walking speed. Specifically, researchers found that every 0.6 mph increase in pace was associated with a 9% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.</p> <p class="""">Compared with people who walked slower or at a casual speed, those who walked at a normal speed of 2–3 mph had a 15% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes. Walking at a fairly brisk pace of 3–4 mph was associated with a 24% lower risk of Type 2 diabetes, while walking at a brisk or striding pace (over 4 mph) was associated with a 39% reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes.</p> <p class="""">In short, the faster you walk, the lower your diabetes risk. </p> <p class="""">""While current strategies to increase walking time and to increase steps per day may be a good approach to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes, it’s also better to encourage people to walk at faster speeds,"" the study’s lead author, Ahmad Jayedi, a nutrition researcher at Semnan University of Medical Sciences in Iran, told NBC News.</p> <p class="""">Brisk walking can help reduce body fat, which in turn lowers the risk of Type 2 diabetes. But Jayedi told NBC News that said reductions in body fat didn’t fully explain the lower diabetes risk among participants in his analysis.</p> <p class="""">Walking at faster speeds can help lower insulin resistance, Jayedi said.

Before the stars took the stage, host Nick Cannon introduced the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell! which gave the panelists — Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Nicole Scherzinger and Ken Jeong — the ability to save a contestant before the two planned unmaskings. </p> <p class="""">Viewers were treated to performances by S'more, Cow and Gazelle. While there were two scheduled unmaskings, only one contestant got the boot. </p> <p class="""">See the highlights from the show below.</p> <p class="""">S'more was the first to take the stage and performed KC and the Sunshine Band’s “That’s the Way (I Like It).” Cow was next, impressing the panelists with his rendition of ""Ring My Bell"" by Anita Ward. </p> <p class="""">Lastly, Gazelle sang ""On the Radio"" by Donna Summer, stumping the panelists.</p> <p class="""">One of the three would be unmasked first, while the other two would go head-to-head in the Battle Royal. The winner of the battle would go on to compete in the special two-hour finale. </p> <p class="""">S'more ultimately was the first contestant to be leaving the competition. But first, each panelist gave their guesses as to who was under the mask. </p> <p class="""">Thicke believed it was Kevin Richardson from the Backstreet Boys, while Jeong also thought it was a member from the same boy band, A.J. McLean. McCarthy Wahlberg guessed it was Ashley Angel Parker from O-Town and Scherzinger thought it was New Kids on the Block member Jordan Knight. </p> <p class="""">McCarthy Wahlberg proved to be correct. The S'more was boy bander Ashley Angel Parker. </p> <p class="""">When asked how it felt to be a part of the show, Parker said, “A little toasty, but amazing. ‘The Masked Singer’ is unlike any other show on planet Earth. Such an incredible experience as a performer.” </p> <p class="""">McCarthy Wahlberg said she was ""a huge fan of O-Town,"" adding, ""Of course, I love my boy banders. Your voice is so beautiful."" </p> <p class="""">Parker replied, ""That means so much. It's been a phenomenal experience.""</p> <p class="""">Cow and Gazelle went head-to-head in the smackdown, both performing “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor.</p> <p class="""">Both impressed the panelists with their renditions but after the judge and audience votes, the celebrity with the least votes was Gazelle. Before being unmasked, the panelists once again guessed who it could be.</p> <p class="""">Thicke said Maggie Q, Scherzinger believed it was Vanessa Hudgens, McCarthy Wahlberg said Shay Mitchell and Jeong guessed it was Constance Wu. </p> <p class="""">However, in an unexpected twist, Jeong couldn't bear seeing the Gazelle leave and decided to use the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell!

But things soon escalated.</p> <p class="""">""I put in for $25 (thousand), and I thought, 'OK, that's a good donation, that'll get it done.' Somebody outbid me for $30 (thousand). Then from 30, now I'm like, 'Now it's getting serious,'"" he said with a laugh. ""Now it feels personal.""</p> <p class="""">Once the bidding escalated to $50,000, he started to suspect his competition was someone he knew. </p> <p class="""">Jason Kelce noted that at one point, the auction site seemed to have crashed.</p> <p class="""">""They were having issues because I was smashing the button as hard as I could, because I couldn't believe that somebody was immediately jumping on every time I bid,"" he joked.</p> <p class="""">McElhenney said his final offer of $62,000 represented his ""favorite"" Eagles player, Jason Kelce. Then he got a text: ""I'm been the one bidding against you, bozo."" </p> <p class="""">The sender? His wife, Kaitlin Olson.</p> <p class="""">""An inside job!"" Jason Kelce shouted as Olson, the winner of the jacket, popped up on the screen during their conversation. They eventually bid $100,000 for the jacket.</p> <p class="""">""This is a foundation that's important to both of us. The jacket looks great on your wife. It's clearly for women — I want it!"" Olson explained.</p> <p class="""">Once they were both in on the action, Olson considered upping her bid to $87,000, referring to Travis Kelce's jersey number (or that of former Eagles Super Bowl champ Brent Celek). But McElhenney ""nixed"" that idea <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/eagles-taylor-swift-bracelet-win-chiefs-rcna126127"" target=""_blank"">ahead of the Chiefs-Eagles matchup.</a></p> <p class="""">""We're all on the Travis Kelce train these days,"" she said. ""Go birds, though.""</p> <p class="""">McElhenney said they felt like $100,000 felt like a ""good number"" for a donation to a good cause — though Olson insists, ""I won the jacket. He will not be wearing the jacket, ever.""</p> <p class="""">McElhenney and Olson both star in ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" and, like their characters, are huge Eagles fans. The couple met on the show and started dating in 2006. They share two sons together.</p> <p class="""">Kylie Kelce, or ""the People's Princess of Philadelphia"" <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CzZITz0uOBl/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" target=""_blank"">as fans on Instagram</a> call her, <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/jason-kelce-kids-rcna119648"" target=""_blank"">shares three daughters with the Eagles center. </a></p> <p class="""">The style of jacket was spotted on Princess Diana in the '90s as she dropped off her son Prince Harry at school in London. The jacket was <a href=""https://www.mitchellandness.com/team-varsity-jacket-philadelphia-eagles-ojbf7004-peayypp"" target=""_blank"">re-created by Mitchell &amp; Ness and retails for $400, but is currently sold out.</a></p> <p class="""">The Kelce family has been in the spotlight this year after the Eagles historic Super Bowl run, the <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/dads/jason-kelce-dad-documentary-rcna116936"" target=""_blank"">""Kelce"" documentary releas</a>e on Prime Video and <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-timeline-rcna105483"" target=""_blank"">Travis Kelce's internet-breaking new relationship with singer Taylor Swift.</a></p> <p class="""">Jason Kelce also made headlines for being a finalist for People's 2023 Sexiest Man of the Year, which went to Patrick Dempsey.

A plant-based mayonnaise made with chickpea flour dubbed <a href=""https://www.fooddive.com/news/kraft-heinz-notco-notmayo-plant-based/644686/"" target=""_blank"">NotMayo</a> was the first product launched by the pair in March. Then, in July, a <a href=""https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/the-kraft-heinz-company-vegan-cheese-notco/"" target=""_blank"">trio of Kraft vegan cheeses</a> in cheddar, provolone and American styles hit stores.</p> <p class="""">“The Kraft Heinz Not Company creates plant-based versions of fan-favorite foods that taste like the real thing, yet don’t require people to drastically change their eating habits,” said Lucho Lopez-May, Kraft Heinz Not Company’s CEO, in a press release. “NotCo brings its revolutionary AI technology that has a proven track record in creating mouthwatering plant-based foods to KRAFT — the beloved mac &amp; cheese brand that sells over a million boxes every day. Leveraging the strengths of both companies, we’re offering the creamy and comforting experience KRAFT Mac &amp; Cheese fans have loved for over 85 years — without the dairy.” </p> <p class="""">The Kraft Heinz Not Company says it will continue expanding its plant-based offerings into several more categories in 2024, both in the U.S. and internationally. Speaking of international markets, <a href=""https://vegnews.com/2021/7/kraft-vegan-blue-box-mac-and-cheese"" target=""_blank"">Kraft Heinz actually launched a vegan mac and cheese in Australia</a> in 2021.</p> <p class="""">The Kraft brand has been on a journey of change for the past few years.

She was, and I quote, “tickled” by the whole day and the great party turnout. She kept saying to our family, “Can you believe I am 98 years old?!”</p> <p class="""">Nope Grandma, we don’t.</p> <p class="""">My grandma is almost an entire century old, but she still gets dressed up like she’s headed to church, is mindful of what she eats and avoids sugary sweets, gets her hair done once a week and still gets as giddy as a <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-5-year-olds-our-2017-holiday-gift-guide-t118882"" target=""_blank"">five-year-old</a> when she sees a present headed her way.</p> <p class="""">As far as <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/gift-guide"" target=""_blank"">gift-giving</a> goes, buying gifts for Grandma Patty can be tricky. There’s nothing she needs per se, yet there are things she would like to have, but space is a bit limited in her downsized living space.</p> <p class="""">When it comes to gifts for seniors it’s all about finding the right balance, according to Debbie Elson, LPN, and a long-term care nurse of 37 years.</p> <p class="""">“Seniors want practical and fun gifts,” says Elson. “They would like things they actually need and will actually use.”</p> <p class="""">They appreciate creature comforts such as lotions, soaps, perfumes, nail care, comfortable shoes, small candies in a dish and <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-gifts-gardeners-t269964"" target=""_blank"">small plants for their window sills</a>, shares Elson.</p> <p class="""">Seniors would prefer not to receive overly extravagant or pricey gifts, she adds. They are also not huge fans of gift cards. “Absolutely, no gift cards!” she emphasizes.</p> <p class="""">Something seniors do have plenty of room in their homes and in their hearts is a nice surprise from their families. Seniors love a little touch of the unexpected and love it when their families go the extra mile. Elson has seen some of the families of her seniors unveil gifts with a pop-up card, a drop-by from the family pet or with a surprise visit from older grandchildren and/or great grandchildren.</p> <p class="""">Lastly, and certainly not least, when it comes to seniors and gifts, don’t just assume you know what your senior wants. At the retirement community where Elson works, seniors are already busy writing their lists, checking them twice and comparing them next to the Target circular.</p> <p class="""">As the experts and my Grandma Patty tell us, gifts with a bit of feeling, a little thought and a heap of practicality will always hit the right note when it comes to the folks who believe that growing older is inevitable, but growing up is optional.</p> <p class="""">Here is a roundup of great gifts for seniors that are expertly suggested and Grandma Patty-approved.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://today.com/shop/11-best-gift-ideas-seniors-2022-t271320#anchor-Giftideasforseniorwomenandseniormen""><strong>Gift ideas for senior women and senior men</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://today.com/shop/11-best-gift-ideas-seniors-2022-t271320#anchor-Inexpensivegiftsforseniors""><strong>Inexpensive gifts</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=""https://today.com/shop/11-best-gift-ideas-seniors-2022-t271320#anchor-Homeandfoodgiftsforseniors""><strong>Food gifts</strong></a></p> <p class="""">Following Elson's ""fun"" gift advice, this abstract painting kit could be a winner. It comes with everything needed to help the senior in your life get their creativity flowing, including paint, brushes, a 2-by-16-inch canvas and more. It's great for beginners, too, in case they're hoping to explore a new hobby.</p> <p class="""">Collecting mementos and memories in the form of photo books and scrapbooks is a tried and true way to preserve and cherish special moments, but have they ever had a video book?

As a <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/work-home-gifts-t196604"" target=""_blank"">remote worker</a>, I enjoy this rocker for the strain it takes off my always achy back. As an avid crocheter, my mom enjoys it for its ability to swing her crafting comfort level up by two notches.  </p> <p class="""">A luxurious gift for a coziness aficionado, this long PJ set is made with temperature regulating knit fabric, that fits and feels as good as it looks. Machine-washable and gentle on the skin, these jammies may wear fancy, but they launder easily. </p> <p class="""">I shared this gift with my son’s grandma just last year and she loved it. Through the magic of technology, I am able to beam photos straight to my mom’s frame. She doesn’t miss a moment thanks to this no-fuss digital picture frame.</p> <p class="""">Deck the halls and freshen the air of your senior's home, courtesy of this powerful midsize wonder.

Said to have the strength to knock out 99% of airborne allergens and a proven track record in the reduction of everyday unpleasant household odors, this gift will be the gift that keeps on giving day in and day out. </p> <p class="""">I have been threatening to steal the heat mat from my chiropractor’s office for years, but now I don’t have to, and neither will your senior with this heated stretching mat from HoMedics. This mat features six stretching programs, offers three levels of intensity, provides relaxing and restorative heat and can be unrolled, rolled out and stored with ease for space-conscious seniors.     </p> <p class="""">This simple yet savvy gadget was designed with seniors in mind and is one of my grandma’s very favorite connectivity tools. With easy-to-use apps, a private family network and built-in 4G, the GrandPad makes it simple for seniors to scroll, shop, search and just say hello.</p> <p class="""">Never liked the look of Yellowstone or always thought Yosemite could use a bit more color?

Recently, a publicist at a beauty company sent me a product to help ease these symptoms: the <a data-commerce-encoding=""true"" data-seller-id=""tdrg226924"" href=""https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2154571&amp;u=1844769&amp;m=131491&amp;urllink=www.mykirei.com/collections/all/products/soothing-steam-eye-mask&amp;afftrack=mykireibykaoeyemaskrcna127039"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">MyKirei by KAO Soothing Steam Eye Mask</a>. It's a disposable mask that promises to relieve eye strain from blue light exposure and release tension in the eye area through a mineral-based steam. This wasn’t the first time I experimented with an <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-silk-eye-mask-sleep-mask-8000-positive-reviews-t116451"" target=""_blank"">eye mask</a> — I’ve tried gel-based ones that you store in the freezer, along with others filled with small beads that require time in the microwave. But this mask is different — it doesn’t need a cooling or heating element to work.</p> <p class="""">Heated eye masks are nothing new if you live in Japan, where warm compresses have been used for centuries to help battle fatigue. In fact, a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387185/"" target=""_blank"">study</a> in the National Library of Medicine showed patients who suffered from dry eye symptoms — such as itchy and watery eyes — displayed improvement after using a heated mask. This particular mask was inspired by Onsens, natural hot springs found throughout Japanese forests. And according to Alexis Young, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, it does have some legitimate skin benefits. “A heated eye mask can help increase blood supply to the skin by dilating blood vessels, temporarily plumping up the skin and making it thicker, brighter and smoother,” she says. And then there’s this: dark circles around the eyes are due to a loss of volume, which makes the underlying vessels more visible. “If the skin is temporarily volumized by increased blood flow and hydration, the dark circles will improve,” notes Dr. Young. “The moist heat can also help minimize the appearance of puffiness, commonly associated with tired eyes.” </p> <p class="""">“Inside the porous fabric is a flexible sheet of iron that produces heat as soon as it’s exposed to the oxygen in the air,” explains Judy Rowand, an associate director at KAO’s Research Lab. “The mask also contains an activated carbon to help evenly distribute water and oxygen for a more sustained reaction.” I find the best time to enjoy the mask is at night, after removing any makeup and contact lenses. Once a week, I’ll rip open the pouch containing a single mask and slip the holes on the sides over my ears. In full transparency, it’s not the prettiest of masks, in fact it actually looks and feels like a panty liner. The mask heats up within a couple of minutes and reaches maximum heat in about ten minutes, and the steam created by the mask is not visible. The temperature never gets uncomfortably hot but is warm enough so it feels like it’s working. </p> <p class="""">I prefer to maximize my mask experience by setting the mood — I’ll ask Alexa to play spa music and turn off the lights in my bedroom. My husband Marc, who is also a fan, finds the relaxing woody and citrus Hinoki scent — which is extracted from Japanese cypress trees — helps him <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/sleep-week-deals-2023-t280948"" target=""_blank"">fall asleep faster</a>. In fact, there have been nights when I’ve had to remove his mask once he’s dozed off. After about twenty to thirty minutes, the mask returns to room temperature and can be removed. </p> <p class="""">Dr. Young suggests applying a <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/andalou-naturals-retinol-alternative-moisturizer-review-rcna121487"" target=""_blank"">thick layer of moisturizer</a> afterwards to help maintain the skin’s hydration levels. I notice my eyes are sometimes blurry after using, but Dr. Young shares this is due to the increased blood flow, is temporary and is nothing to be concerned about. And although this product is vegan-friendly and paraben- and PABA-free, Dr. Young cautions the fragrance could be irritating for those with allergies. “Eyelid skin is the most sensitive skin on the body so someone with fragrance allergies may want to avoid this product,” she says.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Bottom line: I love a good mask and I hate a bad one. This one falls in the former category as it fully covers my eyes and because the innovative ear wrap design holds the mask in place. I also love how lightweight it is and that I can literally slip it in my pocket and take it on a plane for some R&amp;R during a flight. At the end of my interview, Dr. Young reminded me that anything that forces you to close your eyes will lessen eye strain by reducing the use of your ocular muscles. And at $3 a mask (they come in a box of 5 for $15), this mini spa moment is worth every penny. </p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Whether it be weekenders for short trips or a three-piece suitcase set for week-long vacations; you name it, I got it. With the wear and tear that comes with travel, I'm always on the hunt for the next best <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-duffel-bags-t219566"" target=""_blank"">duffel</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-travel-backpack-t219622"" target=""_blank"">backpack</a>, and tote <a href=""https://www.today.com/style/we-want-try-all-these-bestsellers-women-s-handbags-purses-t156696"" target=""_blank"">bag</a> that will meet my wanderlust needs and, most importantly, won't break the bank.</p> <p class="""">While preparing for my last <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-international-travel-accessories-t281229"" target=""_blank"">trip</a> (a bachelorette party in Disney World), the bride kept raving about a bag that she’d gotten from Target. After experiencing baggage issues on two international trips in the past year and insisting on only ever traveling with a carry-on in the future, she needed something big enough to fit absolutely everything. And according to her, she’d found <em>the one</em>.</p> <p class="""">In all of her excitement, she never told me the name of this magic bag, only explaining in length how much she loved it. I immediately scoured Target's travel section and came across the <a href=""https://goto.target.com/c/2465030/81938/2092?subId1=261448travelbackpackode&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcommuter-backpack-black-open-story-8482%2F-%2FA-77377075"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">Commuter Backpack</a>, which appeared to have all of the same amazing qualities my friend had been gushing about. I knew I had to try it.</p> <p class="""">Although I later found out that I had purchased the wrong one (the much-talked-about bag was actually the <a href=""https://goto.target.com/c/2465030/81938/2092?subId1=261448travelbackpackode&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fday-trip-backpack-open-story%2F-%2FA-79295299"" rel=""sponsored"" target=""_blank"">Open Story Day Trip Backpack</a>), my find ended up being more affordable and just as travel-friendly. And after using it almost every day for over a month, I can argue that it might just be even better.</p> <p class=""""><strong>There's plenty of space.</strong> I was pleasantly surprised by how much I was able to fit in the main compartment. Inside, I stashed away a pair of shoes, a backup outfit (just in case my checked bag got lost), a blanket, a laptop case with a charger and an additional phone charger. Even with all that, there was still room to fit more and the bag zipped up easily. (Plus, the fact that this backpack maintained its sleek appearance while filled to the brim was a major plus for me.)</p> <p class=""""><strong>Extra pockets equals extra storage.</strong> The backpack has five additional interior and exterior pockets for holding the essentials. I use the zippered inner pocket to store everything I want to keep safe and clean, like my passport, disposable masks and antibacterial wipes. The backpack also features a padded laptop sleeve for my computer as well as two smaller mesh compartments, a spacious front pocket and an expandable water bottle pocket.</p> <p class=""""><strong>Happiness guaranteed:</strong> The brand offers ""hassle-free"" returns within one year with the receipt. It also comes with a five-year limited warranty.</p> <p class="""">Traveling is already stressful enough without trying to manage big and bulky bags, but having this backpack on hand made every step of the experience much easier. Thanks to a trolly strap, I was able to attach it to my suitcase and easily make my way through the crowded airport and check-in area.</p> <p class="""">When it was time to send off my <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-travel-organizers-t280335"" target=""_blank"">luggage</a>, I just popped the backpack off the handle and put it on. The padded straps ensured that, no matter how heavy it was, it wasn’t uncomfortable to wear. When I want to give my shoulders a rest, the top handles provide another way for me to hold onto it. They connect with a button strap, so I don't have to worry about them flopping around or getting in the way.</p> <p class="""">Even the security checkpoint was less of a hassle. Thanks to all of the pockets, my wallet and laptop were always easily accessible, which made getting through TSA a seamless process.</p> <p class="""">Once I returned home, it was time to get back to the daily grind. For me, that means commuting for anywhere from one and a half to two hours to get to the office (and that's one-way) several days a week. Because of this, I’ve always gravitated toward larger bags that can hold everything I need for the planned day ahead and for anything that could potentially pop up. And as a result, I regularly looked like I was about to go backpacking through Europe with my giant bag. But not anymore.</p> <p class="""">I typically carry my laptop, charger case, portable charger, wallet, keys, mask holder, hand sanitizer, lotion, a makeup bag, a notebook, pens and a physical book or Kindle to read during my commute. While it’s definitely not as much as I <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/carry-garment-bag-amazon-review-t274381"" target=""_blank"">packed</a> for vacation, that’s still a decent amount of I carry daily — and now, very easily. Plus, the ample room leftover is great for fitting any additional goodies I pick up throughout the day.</p> <p class="""">I’m also not particularly gentle with my bags, often shoving them into whatever space I can and exposing them to the elements unshielded. So far, it’s held up very well in both extreme heat and rain. When I purchased the backpack in a light lilac shade, I was worried about how dirty it would get while traveling on public transportation; however, it exceeded my expectations in that department as well. I haven't seen a single stain, smudge or mark.</p> <p class="""">Overall, even though this wasn’t the exact bag my friend was raving about, I think the one I ended up with is even better. The sleek design and spacious compartments are ideal for someone who’s always on the go. It’s perfect for all of my travel needs, whether I’m catching a flight or just heading into the office.</p> <p class="""">One of the most important features in a travel bag is ample pockets, and this crossbody backpack doesn't disappoint in that department. Aside from the front and main compartments, it also has a mesh pocket on each side for things like your water bottle and umbrella, an earphone hole and a pocket on the strap to hold your phone.</p> <p class="""">If you want something more fashion-forward, you can't go wrong with a <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-fanny-packs-belt-bags-t242790"" target=""_blank"">crossbody bag</a>. This highly-rated option comes in almost 30 different colors. ""This is a great small bag for travel. It does NOT look or feel cheap and has a TON of space,"" raved one verified five-star reviewer.</p> <p class="""">Fanny packs are all the rage right now. You can wear it in its classic style around the waist or you can go for a more trendy approach and sling it across your shoulder. This Herschel option comes in a variety of colors and patterns for your choosing.</p> <p class="""">No one wants to be that person who gets bogged down with documents and holds up the airport security line. This spacious travel wallet has a slot for everything you need from IDs to passports. It's big enough to hold documents for several people, perfect for families traveling with younger children.</p> <p class="""">This bestselling packable duffel is perfect to keep folded up in your bag for trips where you anticipate coming home with much more than you left with. It comes in over 40 colors and patterns and has almost 14,000 verified five-star ratings.</p> <p class=""endmark"">If you just like to keep the essentials on you after you check a bag, this mini backpack from JanSport is the way to go. It's spacious enough to fit your wallet, keys, phone, portable charger, water bottle and even a few snacks inside. Plus, once your trip is over, you can use it for day trips or as your new everyday bag if you like to stay hands-free.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Kamari Stewart is an Associate SEO Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

""These are very expensive real pearls. I think you need a lesson on pearls.

It can be plugged in under a desk or used on the couch, and all they have to do is slip their feet in to get cozy.</p> <p>After determining who will take part in your Secret Santa gift exchange, you’ll have to decide whether you assign giftees manually or electronically. </p> <p>If you go the manual route, gather your Secret Santa group in person and have each person write down their name on a piece of paper along with a few items on their wish list. Place all the slips of paper in a vessel and have each person draw a name. If the person draws their own paper, they should pick again.  </p> <p>If you go the electronic route, there are plenty of free websites that facilitate the assigning process. Some popular options include <a href=""https://www.elfster.com/"">Elfster</a> and <a href=""https://www.drawnames.com/secret-santa-generator"">Draw Names</a> . Elfster does the hard work for you by drawing names, making the spending limit clear and sending invitations for the exchange. Draw Names shines because of its name drawing capabilities and group saving feature, which allows you to exchange with the same group year after year.  </p> <p>After you have your giftee, don’t wait to find them the perfect gift! While you might ultimately struggle with trying to find <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/29-funniest-novelty-gifts-year-t142780"">something that’s funny</a> but still useful or affordable and still meaningful. </p> <p>Secrecy is key to a successful Secret Santa gift exchange. Trust us, it’s in the name! After assigning giftees, no one should know who you’re shopping for until the giftee opens their Secret Santa gift. Once the giftee opens the gift, they’ll try to guess who gave them their gift. Good luck! </p> <p>Past secrecy, it’s important to stay within the price limit your group sets. When drawing names, chat with everyone to determine the best budget for your group. </p> <p>If you’re participating in a Secret Santa gift exchange with a group that you don’t know well, consider suggesting that your group incorporate a wish list into your exchange. If you’re drawing names manually, jot down a few gifts next to your name on your slip of paper. Secret Santa websites including Elfster and Draw Names also have a wish list capability. </p> <p>If your group is prioritizing unique and custom gifts, Etsy also has a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/registry?ref=news"">gift registry</a> feature.  </p> <p>“We wanted to help shoppers for the holiday season remove the guessing game, right?” Etsy trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson says. “So this removes the guessing game and also really allows people to be more conscious with their spending because we know that pockets are a bit tighter this year, right? So how can we remove the guessing games and also allow people to really hone in on what they want and be budget conscious.”</p> <p>No matter the wish list you choose, including one in your Secret Santa gift exchange helps everyone stay within their budget and receive a gift they love. </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Jillian Ortiz is a Production Associate at Shop TODAY. </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Bella Druckman is a production coordinator at Shop TODAY.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Real Bravoholics know Hilton held her own for two seasons of the long-running franchise ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,"" spanning from 2021 to 2022.</p> <p class="""">After a dramatic trip to Aspen, in which she clashed with fellow castmate Lisa Rinna, Hilton left the show following Season 12.

She's open to it, Hilton says in an interview with TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">""If it made sense ... if they asked me,"" Hilton says. ""Never say never.""</p> <p class="""">She has positive feelings about her time on the show — up until the end, of course. ""I have to tell you. I had a very good time. I had a blast.

(Rinna replied, seemingly sarcastically, ""This is so sad."")</p> <p class="""">""I like Lisa, I like her,"" Hilton says a year later to TODAY.com. </p> <p class="""">Generally speaking, she had a positive experience during her two season on the show. </p> <p class="""">""I had a really good time with the girls.

'Say this', 'do this,' 'do that',"" she said. ""I’d never heard anybody say that to any of the other cast members. And even if the girls would have a little squabble 10 minutes later, laughing telling jokes. We had a great time.""</p> <p class="""">Despite not being on the show in Season 13, Hilton has been mentioned multiple times by her fellow cast members. </p> <p class="""">When asked if she knows that she's still ""living rent free"" in their minds, she has a cheeky response.</p> <p class=""endmark"">""Yeah!

To show your love for the self-proclaimed gourmand in your life, we’ve rounded up 25 gifts of gastronomy that will satisfy any type of craving. From desserts and snacks to meats and condiments, these sweet treats and memorable eats are the perfect ways to ring in the holidays. And best of all, they’re all sourced from small businesses around the country. Check out our favorites below, including over a dozen you may have seen on TODAY.</p> <p class="""">If you prefer your mustard on the spicier side, look no further than Asheville, North Carolina-based Lusty Monk. The company specializes in a “no-nonsense, full-on, front-of-the-line, off-the-chart, step-aside” trio (original, chipotle and honey) of stone-ground, small-batch mustards that will have your nose running but also have you running back for more. Add them as a finishing touch to sandwiches or mix them into <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/mama-chapman-potato-salad-recipe-t271654"" target=""_blank"">potato salad</a> or <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/best-easiest-deviled-eggs-recipe-t230169"" target=""_blank"">deviled eggs</a>. It will become the refrigerator staple that you or a lucky friend never knew they needed in their life. </p> <p class="""">The party don’t stop till these walk in. Not your grandma’s go-to, gold-wrapped hard caramels, Mouth Party specializes in an exciting array of soft, buttery, slow-cooked gourmet chews, both traditional and inspired (there is one variety with Old Bay!), that you’ll want to scatter in candy dishes throughout your home. In fact, their five-ingredient recipe has spanned four generations, so it’s sure to be a certifiable hit among any connoisseurs of sugar. </p> <p class="""">Tia Lupita owner Hector Saldivar had a mission to share his beloved mother’s hot sauce with the world after she would send him bottles from Mexico. The taste of home became an instant hit with his friends in San Francisco, so he knew it would have mass appeal if packaged and distributed to the rest of the country. And Saldivar’s instincts were spot on: The brand now boasts an impressive line of hot sauces, salsas and grain-free tortilla chips, with the O.G. red jalapeño blend sitting front and center. One of our personal favorites is the chipotle variety, which offers a smokier, sweeter departure from the typical condiments you find on the market.</p> <p class="""">Father-daughter duo Bryan and Katie Flannery have preserved the meat-butchering traditions of their family patriarch, Bryan Sr., offering custom cuts of premium dry-aged beef, from rib-eyes and porterhouses to mini tomahawks and strips. They also sell a fantastic array of gift boxes and other proteins like lamb and pork so that the carnivore in your life can fire up the grill and enjoy the taste of variety this holiday season.</p> <p class="""">There is nothing more satisfying than the crunch of a juicy pickle, and Denver-based The Real Dill wows with a trio of innovative and unique flavors: Jalapeño Honey, Caraway Garlic and Habanero Horseradish. You can, of course, use them to top meat or chop up for a winter salad, but we prefer to eat them straight out of the jar. And if you become an instant fan of the company’s recipes (which is inevitable), you’ll really love its uber-popular bloody mary mix that pairs perfectly with — you guessed it — one of its gourmet pickles. The cucumber-forward bottles will also be sold in a variety pack (original, extra spicy and harvest), just in time to add vodka and tune out the in-laws. </p> <p class="""">Petoskey, Michigan-based JoJo’s Cookie Company whips up the cookie of our dreams: soft, chewy and typically stuffed with something fun and decadent like caramel, candy bars and cream cheese frosting. But its seasonal line of cinnamon roll and hot cocoa cookies have elevated the brand’s status from adorable small business to needs-to-be-in every-grocery-store-in-the-country. It’ll also toss in a special gift message so that recipients won’t feel like they’re taking part in another year of office Secret Santa.</p> <p class="""">Any self-proclaimed basic who can’t get enough pumpkin spice will rejoice after stumbling across Steel City Salt Company. The Pittsburgh-based purveyor of salts, spices, rubs and blends has made a name for itself by selling an uber-popular pierogi salt with onion, garlic, chive and dill, but its pumpkin pie spiced sugar is all the rage during the holiday months. Sprinkle it into morning <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/make-ahead-slow-cooker-maple-oatmeal-t75571"" target=""_blank"">oatmeal</a> or use it to line the glass of your favorite autumnal beverage like a <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/spiked-spiced-slow-cooker-apple-cider-recipe-t239631"" target=""_blank"">spiked cider</a> or apple martini — there is no wrong way to use it. Be sure to check out the brand’s impressive array of thematic gift boxes, as well, which make great last-minute stocking stuffers.</p> <p class="""">The beauty of La Fundidora salsa is its versatility. Practically any of the brand’s five jars can be used on <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/house-xtravaganza-double-cheeseburger-recipe-t220460"" target=""_blank"">hamburgers</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/perfect-grilled-cheese-recipe-t249815"" target=""_blank"">grilled cheese</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/learn-right-way-make-scrambled-eggs-french-technique-t186109"" target=""_blank"">scrambled eggs</a> and even <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/pasquale-jones-pizza-recipe-t292465"" target=""_blank"">pizza</a>. The company even incorporates ingredients like tomatillos, serrano chiles, charred jalapeño and mora chiles that allow them to stand apart from the basic, preservative-laden jars you find in grocery stores. And the freshness is unparalleled, thanks to the company’s commitment to making only small-batch, traditional products by hand using only ethically sourced ingredients with zero additives. For those with dietary restrictions, it’s a product you can feel good about. Don’t miss their cooking sauce trio, as well, with flavors like pastor, chipotle and spicy plum to really up the ante with any Mexican cooking.</p> <p class="""">For many people, coffee is life. And if that person is you or a very special loved one, you can change their life by gifting them coffee from female-owned Nguyen Coffee Supply. The sustainable coffee company prides itself on hand-picked and washed beans from Vietnam that are freshly roasted in Brooklyn without added flavors or oils. The result is a bold, well-balanced robusta that can be brewed to any liking: as a cold brew, pour over, French press, drip or no-frills shot of espresso.</p> <p class="""">An apple a day keeps the doctor away — and nobody has ever said it can’t be covered in caramel. Heather’s Gourmet has perfected the classic carnival dessert, which they also offer in the form of six and 12-month subscription boxes so that lucky recipients can sample multiple flavors. While its standard caramel is divine, some of the brand’s more innovative toppings include Butterfinger, coconut almond dark chocolate, peanut butter M&amp;M’s and white chocolate cinnamon sugar.</p> <p class="""">Kettle-cooked chips reign supreme when it comes to fried potatoes, thanks to their craveworthy crunch and harmonious balance of oil and salt. But some brands offer a product that is almost too aggressive and even dangerous to the gums and roof of the mouth, making the eating experience less enjoyable as you gnaw your way through spuds that are, for lack of a better term, too sharp. Route 11 chips are the exception by producing a flawlessly palatable snack utilizing only the most natural of ingredients and most time-intensive of cooking processes. In fact, they trademarked the term “unhurried potatoes” to allude to their small-batch production facility that focuses more on consistent quality instead of quick mass production. Flavor standouts include Dill Pickle and Sour Cream and Chive, which can be purchased in three-pound tins for any outdoor winter soiree. </p> <p class="""">If you’re from Ohio, you know all about Graeter’s, the 150 year-old family-owned ice cream shop that serves up decadently creamy scoops in shops and freezer aisles year-round. While its signature and most popular flavor, Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip, is deserving of all the fanfare and accolades with fresh Oregon-grown black raspberries, I was beyond impressed with the brand’s simple Madagascar Vanilla Bean. Made with ground vanilla beans and pure vanilla extract, the flavor is, as Graeter’s says, “anything but plain,” and a perfect base to whatever festive topping your heart or stomach desires. Be sure to also look out for three seasonal offerings —cinnamon, peppermint stick and eggnog — to serve at a Secret Santa gift exchange or Hanukkah gathering.</p> <p class="""">Boring, mass produced popcorn tins, be gone! The Hampton Popcorn Company has revolutionized the popcorn tin game by boasting an impressive array of artisanal crunchy treats in packages that are completely customizable. It also offers a variety of unique flavors like blue raspberry and grape, in addition to classics like butter, caramel and white cheddar, so that the true popcorn enthusiast can appreciate more of a creative departure from the norm.</p> <p class="""">The holiday season may bring an abundance of pesky germs and illnesses that can ruin any family get-together, but Immune-Schein’s ginger elixirs can help to keep any immune system strong with potent and flavorful ginger-based elixirs in flavors like golden turmeric, black elderberry and ceylon cinnamon. Sip them straight, use them as a base for cocktails or mix them into salad dressings for a spicier foray into more health-minded eating and drinking.</p> <p class="""">Michele’s Granola prides itself on hand-packing every batch of its delicious homemade granola, following through on a mission to support local food production and employment. In addition to a collection of innovative flavors like lemon pistachio, cherry chocolate and ginger hemp, the brand releases limited-edition varieties like cranberry pecan, salted maple pecan and pumpkin spice. But what I really can’t stop eating is their maple pecan oat and nut butter, a spreadable granola that can be put on toast, <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/perfect-pancakes-recipe-t250272"" target=""_blank"">pancakes</a> or whatever morning carb you fancy to start your day.</p> <p class="""">Don’t forget the vegans in your life who will be tickled to receive an array of shiitake mushroom-based jerkies from Pan’s. The dense, fibrous texture also resembles meat, which means <em>anyone </em>will be satisfied noshing on an umami-packed bag in flavors like zesty Thai, teriyaki and applewood barbecue. Take them on a holiday morning hike or savor them throughout the day to hold you over until larger meals.</p> <p class="""">If you prefer a thinner cracker as part of a winter-themed charcuterie board, Mediterranean-inspired Firehook Crackers are an entertaining must-have. These come in a selection of savory flavors like rosemary sea salt and garlic thyme to complement cheeses, cured meats and dips, but it’s the company’s new crispy graham offering that has everyone talking. Use them in place of your go-to graham cracker for a more artisanal (and scrumptious, frankly) take on the classic s’more while camping.</p> <p class="""">Nothing pairs better with Christmas morning than homemade pancakes, and no stack is complete without a smattering of golden maple syrup. Pappy and Company touts a 23-year-old Bourbon barrel-aged variety that has quickly emerged as the brand’s crown jewel. Rich with notes of vanilla, caramel, butter and oak, the breakfast necessity is also stored in a wooden box so that it is easily giftable (and hidden from other family members who may want to steal a heavy pour).</p> <p class="""">Butters and jams and chutneys, oh my! Those who enjoy dipping and spreading their way through cool weather temps and fireside functions will be grateful to receive a jar from Beth’s Farm Kitchen. The <a href=""https://bethsfarmkitchen.com/pages/about"" target=""_blank"">ethically minded</a> company boasts an impressive array of holiday-themed condiments like apple butter, fig jam, hot plum chutney and even a cranberry horseradish relish. Serve them on that aforementioned charcuterie board or gift them as sets during the month of December for the fabulous foodie in your life who is always looking for the next best product.</p> <p class="""">My, oh, my, the world loves pie. And there is, arguably, no better pecan pie on the market than this old-fashioned confection from Alabama-based Priester’s. The store has been turning out its signature offering, also available in chocolate, since 1935, making it a post-meal must-have for families all over the country. They’re also baked as minis so you can purchase a dozen and give them out as gifts to friends, co-workers, family members and romantic interests.</p> <p class="""">You may have seen the masterminds behind Jackson’s strike a deal on “Shark Tank,” but the business is so much more than a producer of craveworthy (and healthy!) sweet potato chips. Founders Megan and Scott Reamer developed the recipe to accommodate the very specific dietary needs of their son, Jackson, who was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder. Cooked with avocado or coconut oils, the ingredient list is short, but the flavor packs a punch with choices like habanero ranch and spicy jalapeño.</p> <p class="""">Veteran-owned and operated KC Cattle Company specializes in all types of premium meat cuts, but it’s the wagyu beef hot dog that has people barking — er, talking. These gourmet franks, which got a <a href=""https://www.foodandwine.com/meat-poultry/summer-specialty-hot-dog-taste-test"" target=""_blank"">glowing review by Food &amp; Wine magazine</a>, are best served warm (and not charred!) during a winter barbecue, so as to not lose the signature umami flavor. Plop them on a bun with ketchup, dip them in a fancy mustard (like aforementioned Lusty Monk), or simply enjoy them on their own — they really don’t need anything except a plate and an appetite.</p> <p class="""">This may just be the most addictive sweet and salty treat on this entire list. Sold by the bucket, the no-frills Alpine Chocolate Haus chocolate-covered potato chip has developed a devout following of Michigan residents who travel far and wide to get their hands on the simple yet craveworthy concoction that uses Ruffles and the store’s signature milk and dark chocolates. Be sure to buy at least a four-ounce bag for yourself to prevent any trace of regret.</p> <p class="""">Boston-based chef Joseph Leonardi has a passion for plants, so it was no surprise that he started apiaries to house one of the most essential components of successful farming: bees. And what do bees produce? Honey, of course. But Leonardi isn’t just any ol’ honey producer. Instead, he has found a way to infuse it with flavors like chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, black truffle and elderberry. Spoon it directly from the jar for a boost in immunity or drizzle some over that Graeter’s vanilla ice cream for an even sweeter, more decadent treat.</p> <p class=""endmark"">You’re going to need dishware to serve these products and no plate, mug or bowl is more breathtaking than the collections from Philadelphia-based Felt and Fat. The confetti line, in particular, is a blast of rainbow-colored splatters and specks on white ceramic that will have any amateur cook or hostess smile as they set out the fruits of their labor (or the result of a food-focused shopping spree).</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Joey is a writer/editor, TV/radio personality, lifestyle expert, former entertainment publicist and author of ""Basic Bitchen.""</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Shortly thereafter, resellers <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/mcdonalds-limited-edition-adult-happy-meal-toys-are-listed-much-300000-rcna53081"" target=""_blank"">listed them for upwards of $300,000 on eBay</a>.</p> <p class="""">This time around, the chain is working with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kerwinfrost/"" target=""_blank"">Kerwin Frost</a>, a creative director and DJ known for his epic street style. The Kerwin Frost Box will be available at participating McDonald’s locations in the U.S. and other select markets across the globe starting Dec. 11, while supplies last.</p> <p class="""">When you’re ordering the Kerwin Frost Box, you can choose from a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets or a Big Mac. The box also comes with fries, a soft drink and a McNugget Buddy toy.</p> <p class="""">According to a press release, there are six “reimagined McNugget Buddies” that come with mix-and-match outfits. Each toy is inspired by Kerwin’s childhood and lives in Frost Way, “where everyone is welcome to be exactly who they are.”</p> <p class="""">“I’ve loved McDonald’s since I was a kid. I even had my own Ronald McDonald doll that I brought to picture day at school, and it was my dream to collect all the McNugget Buddies,” Kerwin said in a press release. “Now, coming up with my own special set of Buddies — each one representing different aspects of self-expression — it’s unreal, a dream come true.”</p> <p class="""">Here’s a full list of all of the McNugget Buddy collectibles:</p> <p class="""">Inspired by Frost himself, Kerwin Frost is the mayor of Frost Way. He’s described as “a true champion of the citizens and encourages them to be themselves.” He enjoys “adding art to his collection or fixing things around the neighborhood.”</p> <p class="""">Otherwise known as the “Neighborhood Hero,” Uptown Moe is described as a “no-nonsense, street-smart, supportive guy” who everyone “knows and loves.” He’s also known for giving “the best motivational speeches on a whim.”</p> <p class="""">Waffutu is described as the “Curious Optimist” who “was raised by the whole neighborhood in Frost Way.” Waffutu is known for spreading “positivity wherever she goes and can turn any frown upside down with the wave of a wand and tilt of a crown.”</p> <p class="""">BRRRICK is the “Cool Guy” of the group and the “most adventurous Buddy in Frost Way who speaks in puns, loves trying new things and techno music.” He’s described as  “lowkey nervous, but always cool under pressure.”</p> <p class="""">Described as “The Dreamer” of the group, Darla is a “soft-spoken yet peacefully confident singer” pursuing her dream of “becoming a superstar as the lead singer of ‘The Frostettos.’” This cool chick also runs her local McDonald’s in Frost Way and is the employee of the month every month.</p> <p class="""">Don Bernice’s alter ego is the “Wise Stylist” and she’s described as “an experienced fashion designer who creates all the outfits for the Buddies in Frost Way.” She’s also known for “offering stern advice and words of wisdom.”</p> <p class=""endmark"">Frost is selling themed merchandise featuring the McNugget Buddies on his <a href=""https://kerwinfrost.com/"" target=""_blank"">website</a> starting Dec. 11 while supplies last to celebrate the launch of the new meal.

I knew a few of them, but not all. At the end of the meal, they pulled out their phones to schedule another get together. I had my calendar out too, <em>tentative girls night</em> I typed. Time: TBD. </p> <p class="""">Before heading to our cars, we hugged and exchanged ""see you soons!""</p> <p class="""">So imagine my surprise when I was scrolling through Instagram and there they were, piled into a restaurant booth and beaming — without me. My heart sank through the floor.</p> <p class="""">When I woke up my husband and showed him the screenshots, he yawned and rolled back over. </p> <p class="""">“Are these even people you hang out with?” he asked. “I don’t recognize most of them.”</p> <p class="""">“That’s the not the point,” I replied, irritably. Being excluded is a one-way ticket back to middle school.</p> <p class="""">My half-asleep husband sat up squeezed my hand. </p> <p class="""">“You need to let this one go,"" he said. </p> <p class="""">I did the opposite. I spent hours — no, days — obsessing over why I was excluded. Did I try too hard? Had I accidentally offended someone?  Did they chat ahead of time about whether or not to invite me? And if they did — is that worse than them not even considering me? Did anyone stop to think about how it would make me feel when I saw the photos?</p> <p class="""">And note that I’m a hypocrite because I’ve done the same exact thing countless times. <em>Look at me! I’m having fun with my friends! I’m popular! I have a great life! Don't you wish you were here? </em></p> <p class="""">It's not lost on me that all the women at the dinner I attended — myself included — are moms. We spend so much time worrying about when are kids are old enough to use social media and stumble across pictures from parties they weren't invited to. And yet we do it to each other. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://psychologie.unibas.ch/en/persons/christiane-buettner/"" target=""_blank"">Christiane Büttner, a doctoral student in social psychology </a><a href=""https://psychologie.unibas.ch/en/persons/christiane-buettner/"" target=""_blank"">at the </a><a href=""https://psychologie.unibas.ch/en/persons/christiane-buettner/"" target=""_blank"">University of Basel, Switzerland</a>, studies exclusion, specifically the psychological effects of social media ostracism. I reached out to get her perspective, I was also hoping she'd have an easy fix.</p> <p class="""">“Why does being excluded hurt so badly?” I asked.</p> <p class="""">According to Büttner, there are two main reasons — and both of them surprised me. I figured it had to do with childhood trauma, like, ""You never recovered from not being invited to Abby's sleepover party.""</p> <p class="""">But that's not it.</p> <p class="""">“There’s an evolutionary theory that our high sensitivity towards being excluded comes from ancient times, where if you were not part of a group, and did not have access to the hunters and the gatherers, you would die,” she explained. “That’s why people are so sensitive in detecting exclusion. It assured survival.” </p> <p class="""">Büttner said the other theory is a neurological theory that examines how social and physical pain overlap.</p> <p class="""">“If you put someone in a brain scanner, and make them feel excluded, and you look at their brain, the same area lights up that lights up when people feel physical pain,” Büttner shared. “If you give them pain medication, and then make them feel excluded, that area will light up to a lesser extent.” </p> <p class="""">Research has found that people relive social pain over and over again, Büttner said. </p> <p class="""">“When you told about not being included in that dinner, it hurt again — right? But if I ask you to tell me about the greatest tooth pain you’ve ever experienced, it’s not going to hurt again,” she said. “Social pain is enduring.”</p> <p class="""">It now makes sense to me why at age 44, I can vividly recall how I felt when kids came to school dressed in hot pink T-shirts from a bat mitzvah I wasn’t invited to attend. I always thought there was something wrong with me and that I was flawed for my inability to let it go three decades later. </p> <p class="""">After I was excluded from that dinner, I spoke to a friend who once confessed to me that she felt bad when I posted photos of a beach weekend with some of our shared friends. She was heavily pregnant at the time, and we thought she wouldn’t care. She cared, a lot.</p> <p class="""">“I never forgot that,” she said. “I’m not mad about it anymore, I just never forgot.”</p> <p class="""">“I know,” I said. </p> <p class="""">“That bottom line is that it always hurts,” Büttner said.</p> <p class="""">However, there are things you can do to alleviate the pain. Büttner  points to cognitive reappraisal, which involves changing how one thinks about a certain given situation. For instance, instead of going to the worst place — I'm a loser! — when I wasn't invited to the dinner, I could have thought to myself, ""Their loss!"" or ""It could have just been an oversight."" </p> <p class="""">""You can't control what others do, but you can try to control your thoughts,"" Büttner said.</p> <p class="""">I can also control my own actions. </p> <p class="""">I've decided that going forward I am going to ask myself two questions before posting a picture on social media. 1) Will this hurt anyone? 2) Why do I want to share it?</p> <p class=""""> Büttner agreed it's not a bad idea. </p> <p class=""endmark"">""If everyone would be as mindful about what they do online as they are in real life, that would be a great step forward,"" Büttner said. </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Rachel Paula Abrahamson is a lifestyle reporter who writes for the parenting, health and shop verticals.

So if you're trying to cut down on carbs, adding more high-protein, low-carb foods to your diet can go a long way.</p> <p class="""">Protein is used in many bodily functions, including cell maintenance and repair, blood clotting and the production of antibodies. It’s the primary component of many body tissues, such as skin, hair and muscle. Protein is also digested more slowly than carbohydrates, which helps <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/why-do-i-always-feel-hungry-why-you-eat-even-t173620"" target=""_blank"">increase feelings of satiety</a> — aka satisfying your hunger.</p> <p class="""">Protein can be found in a variety of foods, including fish, poultry, meats, legumes, soy, nuts, seeds and dairy. Lesser amounts of protein can also be found in whole grains and vegetables. </p> <p class="""">Below is a list of some favorite high-protein, low-carb choices.</p> <p class="""">One cup of whole almonds contains 30.3 grams of protein. In addition to keeping you full longer than you'd expect, almonds may also reduce heart disease risk, as they lower cholesterol, have anti-inflammatory effects and are high in antioxidants. They’re also high in unsaturated fats and are good for <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-gut-health-foods-rcna63013"" target=""_blank"">gut health</a>.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/black-beans-nutrition-rcna125075"" target=""_blank"">Black beans</a> contain some carbohydrates, but they are a great way to get in plant protein and fiber. A half-cup serving contains 7.5 grams of protein, 7.5 grams of fiber and 20 grams of carbs. They’re also jam-packed with phytonutrients, including anthocyanins and quercetin, both of which act as antioxidants.</p> <p class="""">This lean, white meat is a go-to protein source for good reason. A 4-ounce serving of chicken will give you 26 grams of protein for a minimal 120 calories (and no carbs!). <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/chicken-recipes-t244632"" target=""_blank"">Chicken</a> is also versatile and goes with almost any type of cuisine.</p> <p class="""">Similar to black beans, this legume is higher in carbs than other protein options, but it’s also packed with protein, fiber and antioxidants.<strong> </strong>These little legumes<strong> </strong>are a <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/moroccan-lentil-chickpea-soup-chermoula-recipe-t120261"" target=""_blank"">great addition to soups</a> and salads, especially if you’re trying to reduce your intake of animal protein. They contain about 7 to 9 grams of protein per half-cup serving and 20 grams of carbs.</p> <p class="""">In an age when enthusiasm for cultured dairy is pretty high, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cottage-cheese-benefits-rcna97938"" target=""_blank"">cottage cheese</a> is making a comeback. A half-cup serving of cottage cheese contains about 100 calories, 12 grams of protein and 5 grams of carbs. It is also a versatile ingredient that can be used as the base for a sweet or savory meal, and makes a <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/gridiron-green-goddess-dip-t71661"" target=""_blank"">great dip for veggies</a>.</p> <p class="""">Edamame refers to immature soybeans that are still in their pod, a common appetizer at Japanese restaurants. To prepare them, they’re typically boiled in the pods and then removed and eaten on their own. Edamame contain 17 grams of protein in 1 cup. They also reduce bad cholesterol and are high in vitamin C, calcium, iron and folic acid.</p> <p class="""">Who doesn’t love <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-many-calories-in-an-egg-rcna53691"" target=""_blank"">eggs</a>? They’re an easy, nutrient-dense and wallet-friendly way to pack in protein, as well as a dose of satiating fat, with trace amounts of carbohydrates. With 6 grams of protein per egg, you can easily get a hefty dose through a simple, super healthy two-egg breakfast with sautéed greens.</p> <p class="""">A 4-ounce serving of grass-fed beef has 22 grams of protein and no carbohydrates. Grass-fed and free-range means that the meat comes from cows that graze freely on grass for their entire lives. This kind of beef is the best choice, thanks to a healthier fat profile and more antioxidants. The meat from cattle that eat only grass contains two to three times the amount of conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) compared to grain-finished beef. CLAs are healthy fats associated with reduced cancer risk, reduced <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/10-heart-healthy-diet-tips-reduce-your-heart-disease-risk-t237140"" target=""_blank"">cardiovascular disease risk</a>, and better cholesterol levels.</p> <p class="""">Three tablespoons of hemp seeds contain about 160 calories, 10 grams of protein and just 2 gram of carbs. You’ll also get 240 milligrams of potassium and 15-20% of your daily <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/foods-high-iron-spinach-white-beans-eggs-more-t128036"" target=""_blank"">iron</a> needs (depending on the brand). It’s hard to find that much nutrient density in a single food. Hemp has a beautiful ratio of the common omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but it is also loaded with the less commonly found stearidonic acid (SDA) and gamma linoleic acid (GLA). You need these fatty acids to fight inflammation and protect your heart and <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/best-worst-foods-your-immune-system-t182053"" target=""_blank"">immune system</a>. They are a simple and nutritious addition to your morning smoothie or oatmeal.</p> <p class="""">Lentils are a no-brainer for those looking to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/plant-based-food-list-rcna21164"" target=""_blank"">up their plant-protein consumption</a> (which really should be all of us). Unlike animal proteins that deliver saturated fat — the type of fat that can raise our ""bad"" LDL cholesterol — plant-based proteins like lentils are free of saturated fat. Again, this option is higher in carbohydrates but also <a href=""https://nutritiouslife.com/eat-empowered/high-fiber-diet/"" target=""_blank"">dietary fiber</a>, which is critical for stabilizing blood-sugar levels, as well as lowering LDL cholesterol. A 1-cup serving of cooked lentils will provide 18 grams of protein with 40 grams of carbs.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/almond-butter-vs-peanut-butter-what-s-healthiest-nut-butter-t153562"" target=""_blank"">N</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/almond-butter-vs-peanut-butter-what-s-healthiest-nut-butter-t153562"" target=""_blank"">ut butter</a> is a delicious ingredient or standalone food in so many different contexts.

One 2-tablespoon serving puts about 8 grams of protein on your plate with 6 grams of carbs.</p> <p class="""">When consumed in moderation, pork tenderloin, a lean cut lower in fat than others, can be a healthy, low-carb protein to add to your diet. A 3-ounce serving has 22 grams of protein. Pork also contains vitamin B12 and B6, iron and zinc. It’s also high in selenium, which contains antioxidants. If you’re buying a tenderloin in the store, try to avoid pre-seasoned ones as they usually are high in sodium.</p> <p class="""">Pumpkin seeds are a nutrient-packed ingredient to use all year long — not just after you carve a pumpkin! These small but mighty seeds pack in 9 grams of protein in a 1-ounce serving and also contain important minerals, such as zinc, magnesium and iron. They are also are a good source of healthy fats and add a nice crunch to just about any dish for only 4 grams of carbs per shelled serving.</p> <p class="""">This fish is a delicious source of omega-3s (important for your <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/boost-metabolism-prevent-weight-gain-rcna19394"" target=""_blank"">metabolism</a>) and protein, with about 17 grams per 3-ounce serving and no carbohydrates. When purchasing salmon, make sure you opt for the wild-caught variety. It’s sustainable and can actually provide more nutritional benefit than farm-raised options. Salmon is also a protein source that can be quick and easy to get on the table on a hectic weeknight with a recipe like this <a href=""https://nutritiouslife.com/recipes/parchment-baked-salmon/"" target=""_blank"">parchment-baked salmon</a>.</p> <p class="""">Sardines are a type of small fish often packaged in a tin, one of which contains about 23 grams of protein. Sardines are also high in vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium, and a serving will get you most or all of the way toward your daily goal for omega-3 fatty acids, which protect against heart disease and boost brain health. These little fish can also help improve good cholesterol levels. Try grilling them or roasting them.</p> <p class="""">Keeping a bag of shrimp in your freezer is an easy way to add some protein to any meal, as they defrost easily and cook fast. (Buying them frozen also means they’re preserved at the peak of their freshness, instead of buying them thawed.) Unlike other seafood, shrimp is low in mercury. It also boosts good cholesterol because has high omega-3 fatty acid content and low saturated fat.</p> <p class="""">This green algae is popular with wellness advocate and for good reason. Gram-for-gram, spirulina may be the single most nutritious food on the planet. The quality of the protein in spirulina is considered comparable to eggs. It contains all the essential amino acids that you need: 4 grams in a tablespoon of dried spirulina (and less than 2 grams of carbs). It has a strong flavor, so <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/bright-blue-smoothie-recipe-t171692"" target=""_blank"">mask it in a smoothie</a> — it also adds a fun blue hue!</p> <p class="""">Sunflower seeds’ high fiber and protein content make them an excellent on-the-go snack that will keep you full for a while. They contain 29 grams of protein in a 1-cup serving. Studies have shown that consuming sunflower seeds is associated with a reduction in heart disease risk, as well as lowering of cholesterol and blood pressure.</p> <p class="""">Not only is tempeh a source of gut-friendly probiotics, but it’s also packed with plant-based protein. Try experimenting with new meal options, like a tempeh breakfast hash, tempeh bacon or <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/sweet-soy-tempeh-tempeh-manis-recipe-t205854"" target=""_blank"">tempeh stir-fry.</a> Not familiar with the ingredient? Check out this <a href=""https://nutritiouslife.com/eat-empowered/tempeh-plant-based-protein-how-to-cook-it/"">guide to tempeh</a>. You’ll get about 15 grams of protein and 13 grams of carbs in a 4-ounce serving.</p> <p class="""">Looking to switch up your usual egg scramble? Try <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/how-cook-tofu-top-easy-tips-cooking-tofu-t215629"" target=""_blank"">tofu</a>. I love sautéing crumbled tofu with colorful veggies such as bell peppers, onions and spinach for a high-protein, egg-free breakfast. Don’t forget to add flavor your tofu with spices such as turmeric, black pepper, cumin and garlic. Tofu contains about 20 grams of protein and less than 4 grams of carbs in a half-cup serving.</p> <p class="""">Tuna delivers zero carbs per serving and 24 grams of protein in a 3-ounce serving, so safe to say that it’s a high-protein, low-carb fish.

Has it grown formulaic with age and the addition of nine other American franchises since its inaugural iteration, “The Real Housewives of Orange County”? Surprisingly not. In fact, it’s evolved into a somewhat meta-variant of its roots, with an ever-expanding cinematic universe of women willing to share their lives, creating can’t-look-away-television for throngs of loyal and loud Bravoholics.</p> <p class="""">Holding court since day one at the center of it all has been Andy Cohen, host and executive producer of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” executive producer on “The Real Housewives” franchises and host of reunions across the network. </p> <p class="""">It can be dizzying the velocity at which the Bravo network pumps out content while still managing to find new stones to turn. (Earlier this year, the cultural phenomenon of the “Vanderpump Rules” <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/vanderpump-rules-cheating-scandal-explained-rcna73784"" target=""_blank"">cheating scandal that became known as “Scandoval”</a> even made its way to the White House Correspondents Dinner.) </p> <p class="""">Even more impressive is the fact that nearly 20 years into his tenure, Cohen — the network’s most front-facing personality — still manages to keep up with it all. </p> <p class="""">“All” also includes being a father to two children under 5 years old, overseeing SiriusXM’s “Radio Andy,”<em> </em>co-hosting CNN’s “New Year’s Eve Live” specials and a recent cameo on “American Horror Story: Delicate.” That’s all in between having authored five books throughout his career.</p> <p class="""">And he doesn’t just keep himself busy, but the news cycle, too. A seemingly innocuous sentence from Cohen can spark headlines. Recently, a cursory Google search featured dueling headlines: “Andy Cohen Asks CNN to Allow Alcohol for New Year’s Eve Broadcast” and “Andy Cohen Spills the Tea About His Sex Life and Being a ‘Daddy.’”</p> <p class="""">So finding time in his schedule for this interview and photo shoot was enough to make anyone’s head spin, but Cohen somehow always remains cool, calm and steadfastly collected. “So far, I’m surprised to say I’m somehow, kind of, making it work,” he says with his signature grin. Moments later, he’s smizing in front of the camera for his second photo shoot look of the day at 30 Rock’s rooftop garden. </p> <p class="""">A week after the shoot, the exec jetted off to Las Vegas, where he was a main attraction at BravoCon, a three-day event where 165 Bravolebrities and the thousands of the Bravoholics who love them gathered to commune and worship. </p> <p class="""">“It’s fun to feel like Elvis for a few days,” he says of the event. “But there, <em>everybody’s </em>Elvis. Dolores Catania is Elvis. Austen Kroll is Elvis. And you know what? Tom Sandoval is Elvis,”<strong> </strong>he says, referencing the infamous “Vanderpump Rules” villain. “Everyone gets so much bile on social media, but it’s all love at this thing. And that’s why you just have to take all that stuff with the biggest grain of salt. … You just have to connect with what you’re getting on a human level.”</p> <p class="""">But when you spend as much time in front of a camera as Cohen does, criticism and controversy — the aforementioned “all that stuff” — is not only inescapable, but boundless. As I prepare to ask Cohen about some of these topics, I think about the many journalistic interview tactics that might help me steer the ship: blunt questions, intent listening, putting the subject at ease. But interviewing someone like Cohen, who spent a decade as a young producer at CBS News before his nearly 20 years at Bravo, means you’ve got a co-captain rather than a passenger. </p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">I think I’ve gotten way better at knowing what the line is. And I think it’s from sometimes getting burned.</p> <p class="""">He knows the questions before I ask them; this is one source I’m not going to catch off guard, and any juicy bits will be given, not extracted. “I think that sometimes when you do or say something that gets picked up everywhere, it’s initially very jarring,” he says. “It’s scary. So I think I’ve gotten way better at knowing what the line is. And I think it’s from sometimes getting burned.”</p> <p class="""">Take earlier this year, when the late-night host caught flack after he congratulated<em> “</em>New Jersey’s” Dolores Catania on losing weight and inquired, “Ozempy?” in reference to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/ozempic-before-and-after-rcna99185"" target=""_blank"">Ozempic, a drug used to treat diabetes</a> that has become a go-to for celebrities looking to shed pounds. </p> <p class="""">Fans on social media were quick to criticize Cohen for praising weight loss. Reflecting on the incident, he says it taught him an important lesson. “What I have been careful to say (since then), especially with Emily Simpson, (“The Real Housewives of Orange County” star) who lost a ton of weight, is, ‘I thought you looked great before. <em>You</em> still look great.’” </p> <p class="""">“The note (to self) is: Don’t pat someone on the back for being thin, because what you’re then doing is perpetuating a false narrative about beauty, and that’s not right.” </p> <p class="""">Cohen’s willingness to take “the note” might just be one of the components to his longevity in the world of television, both in front of and behind the camera. And with three major anniversaries on the horizon — his 20th at Bravo, the 18th of “Housewives,” and the 15th of “Watch What Happens Live” — Cohen is doing some reflecting, while also keeping his eyes firmly on the future. </p> <p class="""">Whether the topic is reality stars’ quests for beauty or their personal lives, Cohen says he feels an important part of his job is to ask the questions many at home on their couch are wondering, regardless of how probing or intrusive they might be. </p> <p class="""">“I’ve asked incredibly personal, incredibly direct questions of Real Housewives for years. I think that was kind of my practice ground for going in and then saying to J. Lo, ‘Why were you on your phone texting during Mariah Carey’s performance?’ I think the show has a reputation of being the place that you go for uncensored, unpredictable fun.”</p> <p class="""">He adds: “If I go too far, <em>believe</em> me — my audience calls me out, and so does the talent. I’ve had guests turn on me during the show. That is authentic and interesting TV, and I think it’s why people like the show. I’ve had guests really get mad at me, but I’ve also had many a Kardashian say, ‘I’m <em>so </em>glad we talked about that.’”</p> <p class="""">About that. In the lead-up to this interview, there’s an oft-referenced moment from Season Eight of “The Real Housewives of New York City”<em> </em>that kept cycling through my mind. When star Bethenny Frankel says that she has something to tell her co-star/frenemy Luann de Lesseps, de Lesseps responds: “Please don’t let it be about Tom,” referring to her soon-to-be husband. Bethenny immediately responds with both deflation and despondency: “It’s about Tom.” </p> <p class="""">In the interview for this story, the elephant in the room is not about Tom, but rather … Bethenny. Since her first season in 2008, Frankel has successfully utilized the “Housewives” platform and parlayed it into a multimillion-dollar low-calorie alcoholic drink brand, Skinnygirl (founded in 2009 and sold for an estimated $100 million two years later), as well as a slew of television gigs, including her own talk show. In 2022, she launched a “Housewives” recap podcast called “ReWives,” distributed by iHeartPodcasts. </p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">If I go too far, believe me — my audience calls me out, and so does the talent.</p> <p class="""">This year, however, she has seemingly set her sights on burning down the house that helped build her. In <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@bethennyfrankel/video/7257963592526646574"" target=""_blank"">a July TikTok video</a>, Frankel launched what she calls a “reality reckoning.” Her intention, she explained, is that she’s “fighting for systemic change” for the treatment of reality television personalities.<em> </em>(<em>Disclaimer: Bravo and TODAY share the same parent company, NBCUniversal.</em>)</p> <p class="""">In August, attorneys on behalf of Frankel issued a legal letter to NBCUniversal alleging that “a significant number of individuals” who had appeared on Bravo had been “mentally, physically, and financially victimized by NBC and threatened with ruin should they decide to speak out about their mistreatment.” Bravo responded <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/bethenny-frankel-reality-star-legal-fight-bravo-response-ndas-1235704905/"" target=""_blank"">in a statement to Variety:</a> “Confidentiality clauses are standard practice in reality programming to prevent disclosure of storylines prior to air. They are not intended to prevent disclosure by cast and crew of unlawful acts in the workplace, and they have not been enforced in that manner.”</p> <p class="""">On Oct. 30, Vanity Fair published an article in which former “Housewives” cast members spoke about a lack of intervention from producers when it came to excessive drinking, as well as allegations of discrimination and microaggressions. (Bravo has declined to comment further to TODAY.com on the Vanity Fair piece.) When <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CzBsP-oL8U9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=5815c7ca-539b-4fce-a43b-8ba1a0be5e1d"" target=""_blank"">sharing </a><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CzBsP-oL8U9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=5815c7ca-539b-4fce-a43b-8ba1a0be5e1d"" target=""_blank"">the article </a><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CzBsP-oL8U9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=5815c7ca-539b-4fce-a43b-8ba1a0be5e1d"" target=""_blank"">on Instagram</a>, Frankel <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/bethennyfrankel/"" target=""_blank"">alleged</a> that Bravo is a “polluted environment profiting from women’s mistakes and misery” and accused her former workplace of “abus[ing cast members] nightly with games and questions designed to ruin their lives while making the masters of this universe rich and famous.”</p> <p class="""">It’s a pivot from her earlier stance of often crediting the show with helping her build her empire. “It’s amazing, the gift that you guys have given me… you’ve been amazing to me,” Frankel said to Andy on his show in <a href=""https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city/season-7/100th-episode-watch-what-happens-live-special"" target=""_blank"">2015</a>. To Vanity Fair in October, she said: “I loved that I was Andy’s favorite. I loved that I was able to make good television and produce it at the same time. I loved that producers knew I was the best. I was in the machine. I was the machine. I created the machine.” </p> <p class="""">It’s a machine she stayed a part of, even after ending her time on screen. In a Nov. 8 interview with <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/streaming/columns/bethenny-frankel-bryan-freedman-mark-geragos-reality-stars-1235682247/"" target=""_blank"">Variety</a>, Frances Berwick, chairman of NBCUniversal Entertainment — and former president of Bravo — shared that Frankel has even pitched three shows to Bravo, all around Bravo IP, including a TV version of her podcast. In response, Frankel told Variety: <em>“</em>Me pitching shows to Bravo months before opening my eyes isn’t the smoking gun they think they have…and if that’s their biggest argument against the reality reckoning, they better get back to the drawing board.” </p> <p class="""">A week prior to the Vanity Fair article’s release, when Cohen and I first spoke on Zoom, before I could even broach the subject, he gave me a knowing look. “Look, there’s always one question that you feel like you really want to ask. You might be scared, it might be off limits. For you, for this interview, it may have been about <em>that </em>former Housewife,” he said, clearly purposely not referring to Frankel by name. </p> <p class="""">But it’s not<em> just</em> about Frankel. In recent years, like <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/love-is-blind-sexual-assault-lawsuit-tran-dang-thomas-smith-rcna119321"" target=""_blank"">other streamers and networks that air reality TV shows,</a> Bravo and the production companies it partners with have been at the center of allegations about <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/2023/10/eboni-k-williams-real-housewives-of-new-york-quit.html"" target=""_blank"">on-set racism,</a> claims of <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellendurney/nene-leakes-lawsuit-real-housewives-andy-cohen"" target=""_blank"">hostile work environments</a> and <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/real-housewives-drinking-problem-we-to-blame-bravo-shannon-beador-dui-arrest-1234830340/"" target=""_blank"">criticisms of excessive drinking</a> on reality series. </p> <p class="""">In 2021, an NBCUniversal internal investigation into “The Real Housewives of New York City” star Ramona Singer and her alleged usage of the N-word during a conversation with a Black producer was found inconclusive. On Oct. 31 of this year, <a href=""https://pagesix.com/2023/10/31/entertainment/ramona-singer-tries-to-downplay-her-use-of-n-word-while-practically-using-slur/"" target=""_blank"">Page Six published text messages</a> Singer allegedly sent to their reporter stating that during the conversation, she said “N-word” and did not actually use the racist slur. A week later, Singer was noticeably absent from BravoCon. (Both Singer and Bravo have declined TODAY.com’s request for comment on Singer’s current and future status with the network. As of publish time of this story, “RHONY Legacy: Ultimate Girls Trip,” which stars Singer, was still slated for a Dec. 14 premiere on Peacock.) </p> <p class="""">In September, NBCUniversal sent out updated workplace conduct guidelines to its production partners, which included requirements for alcohol training, new mental health support measures and guidance for improved communications between production companies and the network. </p> <p class="""">Despite solely serving in the role of executive producer and reunion host, as a face for Bravo, Cohen is often the recipient of blame, expected to provide answers when scenarios like these arise. A week after the Vanity Fair story was published, I spoke to him again, this time on the phone to further probe on the topic of the “reality reckoning” and the Vanity Fair story. He offered this in response:</p> <p class="""">“I think it was a factually incorrect rehash. I think much of it had been reported already, and it lacked context. You can say, ‘Oh, Andy did a poll comparing two Housewives’ bad nose jobs,’ and without any further explanation, that may cause you to raise your eyebrow. But the continuation of the sentence would be ‘...after an episode of the Jersey ‘Housewives’ where two women compared what they described as their bad nose job.’ So I just thought that there was a lot of context missing.” </p> <p class="""">He continued: “And specifically, it was a rehash of things that have been reported on and — most importantly — addressed by Bravo. We’ve addressed each of the things that did happen, and we’ve moved forward. I think BravoCon was further validation of what is really going on between the reality of our relationship with our talent and the place that these shows hold with our audience.”</p> <p class="""">Case in point of that relationship with talent: During BravoCon’s first annual Bravos in November, an award show celebrating all things — you guessed it — Bravo, “The Real Housewives of Orange County” original cast member Vicki Gunvalson became the first-ever Wifetime Achievement Award recipient. During her acceptance speech, she turned to Cohen and said: “You saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.” </p> <p class="""">Cohen says that’s a sentiment he heard often from Housewives and Bravo talent throughout the weekend. “I think that is representative of how these shows wind up empowering the women on them to take charge of their voice and who they are.”  </p> <p class="""">So if not a reality TV reckoning … what <em>has</em> kept Andy Cohen up at night through the years? </p> <p class="""">“There have been a few things. One was that we were about to start shooting Season One of ‘Top Chef,’ and we didn’t have a host.”</p> <p class="""">He adds that the recent reboot of “The Real Housewives of New York City” was another. The series came to a screeching halt after its 13th season, which ended amid the racism accusations involving Singer. The season finale aired on Sept. 7, 2021, and there wasn’t a peep about cameras going up again until a March 2022 Variety <a href=""https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/real-housewives-of-new-york-city-reboot-new-cast-rhony-throwback-1235211905/"" target=""_blank"">headline</a>: “Bravo to Reboot Real Housewives of New York City With New Cast.” It took nearly two years off the air, but finally, in July of this year, the new New York — not rebranded, simply rebooted — made its maiden voyage. It was a big test for both Cohen and the network in attempting to affirm that new blood can revitalize a show’s dwindling heartbeat.</p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">I think the show has a reputation of being the place that you go for uncensored, unpredictable fun.</p> <p class="""">“The casting, whether we were getting it right, and then when the cuts started coming in: ‘Was the storytelling right? Were people going to like it?’” he explains of the reboot’s most challenging details. “But I’m so gratified. I’m just relieved. All-caps relieved is really how I’m feeling. I know for sure with every bone of my TV-producer body that next season will be so much better, because some of the women knew each other better than others. Some didn’t know each other. None of them knew Jenna (Lyons). And so now … this is a very tight-knit group with a lot going on and a lot of opinions and a real shorthand about them that I think will really benefit another season.”</p> <p class="""">Cohen recently wrapped hosting the “Housewives” reunions for New York, Orange County and Salt Lake City. Bravo reunions — which also happen for other franchises like “Vanderpump Rules” and “Summer House” — have become an integral space for cast members to enter the pantheon and duke it out with the collective goal of moving forward. </p> <p class="""">“This is a universe in which things are forgiven in ways that they may not necessarily be in life. The offenses are greater than they are in life, and the forgiveness is sometimes more … forgiving, for lack of a better word. I’m an unlicensed therapist, and sometimes, it works.”</p> <p class="""">Sometimes, however, Cohen loses control of the room, and loses his temper as well. “Shut up!” an exasperated Cohen told the women during “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” reunion in June 2023 as a stunned silence fell over the room.</p> <p class="""">“I think I’ve gotten more comfortable and more verbal in the last few years, frankly, expressing myself and little bits of opinions,” he says. Still, he acutely understands that part of his role requires him to hold the center. It’s one of the reasons Cohen is wary of vacating his position both on “WWHL” and as the de facto reunions host — and why he’s not yet thinking about who might replace him.</p> <p class="""">“There are a couple people that I’ve thought would be really good, but some of them are super opinionated,” he says. “And if the Housewives are still going, you have to figure out a way to be somewhat of an island if you’re going to be sitting down with Housewives that you’ve been super vocal that you don’t like.”</p> <p class="""">Speaking of vocal: There are few fandoms as devout and as loud as the Bravoholics, who can be as demanding as the Bravolebrities they mercilessly tweet about. </p> <p class=""""><strong><em>Fire her! </em></strong></p> <p class=""""><strong><em>Bring her back! </em></strong></p> <p class=""""><strong><em>She needs to be put on pause! </em></strong></p> <p class="""">Cohen sees it all on social media. </p> <p class="""">“I think we can tell when someone is landing or not with viewers,” Cohen says, citing Monica Garcia, the newest “Salt Lake City” cast member, as an example of someone fans are responding strongly to. “But listen, it’s always great to have things reinforced. Sometimes I go out and just talk to housewives themselves in suburbia who are not on Twitter, who swear by the shows, and they’re certainly not as dogmatic.”</p> <p class="""">“And also, I think gay Twitter might have a different reaction to a Housewife or to things happening on the show than a lot of the suburban women who are watching, and I think it’s also mainly suburban women or mainly women (in general) that are watching. So it’s important to listen to <em>everybody </em>and take all that into account.”</p> <p class="""">As “Housewives” stars continue to stray beyond the original series, with spinoffs like “Ultimate Girls Trip” becoming their own success stories, as well as other reality series casting former Bravo stars — including Peacock’s “The Traitors,” CBS’s “Celebrity Big Brother” and Amazon Freevee’s “The GOAT” — there’s always a conversation about the tipping point of overexposure. After all, these reality stars can quickly go from fan favorites to most-hated — and back again, if they’re lucky.</p> <p class="""">“We happen to have 10 ‘Housewives’ series in production right now, so some could argue that we’ve hit that point,” Cohen says of the idea of overexposure. “But they’re still all so popular that we’re feeding the beast at this point — the beast being our ever-loving fans.”</p> <p class="""">While the executive’s day job largely deals in sharing the lives of people on national television, ironically, overexposure is something Cohen is contending with in his own life, particularly when it comes to his children. Cohen began detailing his journey with surrogacy in 2019 when he welcomed his son, Ben — now 4 — and then his daughter, Lucy, last year. He’s detailed much of his fatherhood journey, including his efforts to help push surrogacy’s legalization in New York, on social media.</p> <p class="""">It’s a balance, he says, figuring out the line between sharing and oversharing. “The last time I showed Ben’s face (on social media) was when I got my star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And Lucy, I’m teetering towards not showing anymore. I just feel funny about it. People need to understand that my kids are not me and they didn’t sign up for this.” </p> <p class="""">Cohen admits, however, that he doesn’t quite have a solution just yet. “I’m figuring it out as I go. My mom is really on me about it. She’s really like, ‘You have to stop.’ She was very vocal about, ‘OK, you can’t show Ben anymore. When are you going to stop showing Lucy?’”</p> <p class="""">Cohen credits becoming a father with helping give him a deeper window into the experiences of the Housewives. For instance, when “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Kandi Burruss joked about having a “baby mama” after expressing guilt over welcoming her child via surrogate, Cohen jumped in. </p> <p class="""">“Don’t you ever say that, because <em>you</em> are the mother,” he told Burruss during the 2018 ""Housewives of Atlanta"" reunion. “And to say she’s your baby’s mom is taking away from <em>you</em>,” he stressed. </p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">I’m an unlicensed therapist, and sometimes, it works.</p> <p class="""">“You can say a lot about the Housewives, but they’re great moms,” Cohen says now, reflecting on the ways in which his parenting journey has given him a greater understanding of many of the Housewives. “One of the unexpected joys of my time with the Wives is that now, when we’re on breaks from reunions, we’re sitting there waiting, getting touched up and stuff, and we all talk about our kids and about parenting. It’s opened up a portal to the way they parent that I never used to care about very much, frankly.”</p> <p class="""">It’s clear that fatherhood has helped Cohen find perspective within the cacophony of noise online. </p> <p class="""">“If I go on Twitter at any given moment, it’s a battlefield about politics, or people telling me that I messed up a show completely, or that I’m this, that, or the other,"" he says.</p> <p class="""">""But Ben today: I was like, ‘Ben, I love you.’ He goes, ‘However many stars there are in the sky is how much I love you.’ And I’m set for the day. I don’t give a f--- what anyone’s saying about me on Twitter. This little boy loves me for as many stars as there are? The rest doesn’t really matter!”</p> <p class=""""><strong>CREDITS</strong></p> <p class=""""><em>Photographer: </em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/djdumpling/"" target=""_blank""><em>Justin J.

""For instance, the hood might have a wool lining to keep me extra warm whereas the sleeves might be lined in a more slippery fabric so that my arms can go in and out easily.""</p> <p class="""">Cotton is the key to hoodies. Our experts say this soft fiber gives you the comfort you want while the structure also keeps you cool. </p> <p class="""">The natural material is known as the all-weather fabric because its structure provides a layer of added insulation while being breathable. Cotton also has <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/moisture-wicking-clothing-t221186"" target=""_blank"">sweat-absorbing properties</a>, making a cotton hoodie the perfect addition to your next workout outfit. ""Cotton also has great breathability characteristics, again contributing to its increased comfort against the skin,"" Reddy-Best says. </p> <p class="""">Love to work out? Battle says look for hoodies with a cotton and polyester blend to get a material that is better temperature-regulating and has moisture-wicking properties.</p> <p class="""">Additionally, our experts suggest shoppers avoid buying hoodies with invisible zippers as they are more likely to snag. Typically, there is little information provided about zipper characteristics in online product descriptions, which can make it hard for shoppers to determine quality. Instead, our experts suggest shoppers hit the stores and try zippers for themselves. </p> <p class="""">""If it shows <em>any</em> signs of difficulty, that would be an indicator. I would suggest zipping it up and down multiple times, sitting, standing, squatting in the hoodie to make sure that the zipper stays zipped up, does not snag, etcetera,"" Reddy-Best explains. </p> <p class="""">Reddy-Best says one technical detail that increases the comfort of a center front zipper is a fabric shield near the neckline, especially for places<strong> </strong>where the zipper might touch your face. </p> <p class="""">""This fabric is a barrier between your skin and the abrasiveness of the zipper,"" she clarifies. </p> <p class="""">Finally, function always reigns supreme. Making sure your hoodie of choice has functional pockets will go a long way, according to our experts. </p> <p class="""">When shopping, stylist Beverly Osemwenkhae suggests you keep your wardrobe and lifestyle in mind. </p> <p class="""">""You want to look at the purpose of the hoodie,"" Osemwenkhae says. ""Think about how you plan on styling it and the items in your wardrobe it will work with.""</p> <p class="""">Each brand’s mission matters. Stylist Karis Battle says that brands that prioritize sustainability often have higher-quality garments. </p> <p class="""">According to <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-fashion-industry-environmental-impact/#xj4y7vzkg"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg</a>, the fashion industry is responsible for the production of up to 10% of the global carbon dioxide output. The <a href=""https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/unep-and-un-climate-change-provide-fashion-communicators-practical"" target=""_blank"">United Nations Environment Programme</a> also reports that the industry accounts for one-fifth of the 300 million tons of plastic produced globally each year. </p> <p class="""">While the term <a href=""https://www.stkate.edu/newswire/news/sustainability-in-fashion-industry"" target=""_blank"">sustainability</a> has many meanings, brands dedicated to the cause typically try to create pieces through processes that avoid harm to people and the planet. </p> <p class="""">To Battle, fashion sustainability involves everything from the sourcing of materials to the manufacturing processes, and even includes how brands manage their waste and carbon footprint.</p> <p class="""">Our experts suggest shoppers look out for these markers when shopping sustainably: </p> <p class="""">Your personal style will determine whether you gravitate to a zip-up or a pullover hoodie. </p> <p class="""">Our experts say a zip-up hoodie is for shoppers who prefer to be more casual. </p> <p class="""">If you want to pull together an outfit around your zip-up hoodie, Osemwenkhae suggests pairing it with a vintage tee and ripped boyfriend jeans. ""You always want to include an interesting piece to elevate the look,"" she says. </p> <p class="""">A pullover hoodie can be casual or elevated, depending on how you choose to style it.  </p> <p class="""">Battle says pullovers are more streamlined and pair well with simple bottoms, allowing the hoodie to be the focal point.</p> <p class="""">If you go for more of a cropped hoodie, Osemwenkhae says it ""can be worn with high waist[ed] relax[ed] trousers.""</p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester | <strong>Size type:</strong> Unisex | <strong>Size:</strong> S-XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p> <p class="""">Stuzo is Reddy-Best's go-to place for buying a high-quality hoodie. </p> <p class="""">""They manufacture in Los Angeles<em> </em>and the owner has a tight connection with the manufacturer, she says. ""I also love their message about gender equity in their branding.""</p> <p class="""">Reddy-Best says the brand's attention to detail in its various designs is what sets this brand apart. </p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Fleece | <strong>Size type:</strong> Regular | <strong>Size:</strong> XS-L | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p> <p class="""">Alo finds a way to make the most basic staple a little more exciting, according to Osemwenkhae. </p> <p class="""">Even though this cropped hoodie is simple, it brings luxe to any everyday outfit. You can easily style this cropped hoodie by dressing it up or down for a workout or a night out.</p> <p class="""">One verified reviewer described this hoodie as super flattering. </p> <p class="""">""I am in love with this hoodie. I thought I wouldn't like the shoulder pads but they give an added hourglass effect to your figure,"" the reviewer said. ""It's so soft, cozy and stylish."" </p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester | <strong>Size type:</strong> Regular | <strong>Size:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8</p> <p class="""">Battle says Champion has some of the highest-quality hoodies on the market. </p> <p class="""">""Champion hoodies offer a classic, timeless look with durable construction,"" she says.</p> <p class="""">The reverse weave hoodie is a hit with millennials and Gen Z alike with over <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/champion-reverse-weave-hoodie-outfit"" target=""_blank"">11 million videos</a> about it on TikTok. </p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester | <strong>Size type:</strong> Regular | <strong>Size:</strong> XS-M | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p> <p class="""">Osemwenkhae says Ba&amp;Sh has great everyday pieces that have a fun twist.</p> <p class="""">The Daydan hoodie has a chic, casual style with a large hoodie to hold all of your hair. This hoodie is even made of eco-responsible fabric that's made of at least 70% organic fibers. </p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester jersey fleece | <strong>Size type:</strong> Unisex | <strong>Size:</strong> L-XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p> <p class="""">“I’m not huge on hoodies, but I received this when I went to Metallica over the summer and it’s probably the highest quality, well-constructed sweatshirt in my current rotation,” senior editor Jess Bender says. </p> <p class="""">This hoodie is a must-have on most of Bender’s lunch walks. The kangaroo pouch pocket is big and fits her brick of keys and multiple phones. </p> <p class="""">Want to shop while supporting a great cause? This limited-edition hoodie helps students in the United States providing direct support to community colleges to enhance their trade education programs. </p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester | <strong>Size type:</strong> Regular | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 17</p> <p class="""">Crew necks have a special place in editorial assistant Sierra Hoeger’s heart. It’s a big deal for her to find a hoodie she likes. </p> <p class="""">“I borrowed this one from my mom last time I went home and then I ‘accidentally’ packed it (sorry Mom!). I love how oversized it is, so I can toss it on to wear with leggings or sweatpants,” she gushes. “Plus, it’s super cozy to bundle up in for days spent on the couch.”</p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton fleece | <strong>Size type:</strong> Regular | <strong>Size:</strong> XS-2XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p> <p class="""">One <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jigglyjulia/video/7288479681454624043?is_from_webapp=1&amp;web_id=7135113685259453998"" target=""_blank"">viral TikTok</a> lays out the hoodie rules. The best hoodie must have a boxy abdomen, a wide length in the sleeve under the arm and one that is loose on the neck. </p> <p class="""">Los Angeles Apparel has cracked the code. Photo editor Vivian Le says this unisex fleece hoodie “passes all the requirements of a hoodie that hoodies.”</p> <p class="""">She says it has a wide sleeve around the armpits that makes for a nice boxy shape.</p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled fleece | <strong>Size type:</strong> Unisex | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS-3XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6</p> <p class="""">Editor and producer Julie Ricevuto raves about Jambys hoodies. The Chilluxe design is made of recycled fleece and has hidden thumb loops to keep your fingers just as warm. </p> <p class="""">Shoppers have dubbed this the “coziest hoodie on the market” and one verified reviewer explained why. </p> <p class="""">“[It’s] totally worth the price and I am somewhat frugal. I am not a fashion guy at all — I didn’t care about clothing in the slightest before Jambys but the second the original Jambys hit my skin my life changed,” the reviewer said. “The Chilluxe line is thicker than the originals with the outside of a regular hoodie and the inside made of the softest, fluffiest fleece material-perfect suited for chillier days. Simply spectacular!”</p> <p class=""""><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, spandex | <strong>Size type:</strong> Short, regular, tall | <strong>Size:</strong> 2XS-2XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 38</p> <p class="""">Aritzia is known for having the best basics and their hoodies don't disappoint. </p> <p class="""">Editorial assistant Erica Marrison says she is in love with this TNA cozy fleece hoodie from the brand. </p> <p class="""">""It comes in tons of different colors, as well as short, medium and long lengths so you can get the perfect fit,"" she says.

A sweatshirt is a simpler, hoodless pullover, Battle says. </p> <p>Sweatshirts are also a bit more casual when it comes to styling. Our experts say hoodies offer more versatility with their design. </p> <p>Osemwenkhae says a hoodie can be layered with any fabric depending on the silhouette and style. </p> <p>If you're confused, you're not alone. Many people in the fashion industry have used these terms interchangeably. </p> <p>Battle says an oversized hoodie is great if you're going for a relaxed, effortless look. </p> <p>""Pair that hoodie with <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-cargo-pants-t214134"" target=""_blank"">cargo pants</a> or <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-amazon-leggings-t225378"" target=""_blank"">leggings</a> and your favorite sneakers to balance the outfit,"" Battle suggests. ""Or wear it as a dress with boots for a bold statement.""</p> <p>Want to tap into a more modern look? Osemwenkhae suggests shoppers pair an oversized hoodie with a skinny leather trouser and sock kitten heel booties. </p> <p>While there are endless ways to style a cropped hoodie, stylist Michaela Leitz has some tips to make your styling dreams come true. </p> <p>To create a balanced and trendy look, Leitz suggests pairing a cropped hoodie with high-waisted wide leg jeans. </p> <p>""This combination marries the casual comfort of the hoodie with the structured appeal of the jeans, creating a harmonious blend of style and comfort,"" Leitz says. </p> <p>Have more of a sporty vibe? Adding cool sneakers infuses a sporty vibe, while a shopper bag adds a practical yet stylish touch, perfect for day-to-day wear. </p> <p>If you want to shake up your style, but you like to stick to the classics, Leitz suggests you layer a silk sheath maxi dress beneath the cropped hoodie. </p> <p>""Opt for a monochromatic color scheme, like beige, for a sophisticated yet casual vibe,"" Leitz explains. ""This unique combination blurs the lines between relaxed and refined, creating a compelling style narrative.""</p> <p>This look can even slide right into your nightlife plans. </p> <p>""Don't forget to add a clutch if you're planning to rock this look for a cocktail evening, Leitz adds. ""It's the perfect accessory to complete your outfit while also providing practical storage for your essentials.""</p> <p>Our experts suggest playing with textures and lengths when layering.  </p> <p>Osemwenkhae says wearing a button-up can be quite quirky but very fashion-forward. </p> <p>""If it's a lighter weight hoodie, layering it under a blazer can be super cute as well,"" she says. </p> <p>Battle suggests you experiment with different combinations to find what works best.</p> <p>""A hoodie under a jacket, for instance, creates an edgy yet comfortable look,"" she says.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Our experts say you should always, always, always follow the care instructions on the garment's tag. </p> <p>""Garments are made of different fibers and fabric structures; they each will require different care practices,"" Reddy-Best explains. </p> <p>If you are unsure about how to care for your item, you can always test a cleaning procedure in an inconspicuous area. </p> <p>""That is the No. 1 rule for garment care,"" Reddy-Best says. ""Follow what the manufacturer said. There certainly can be mistakes in the instructions, which might lead to something like dyes bleeding or differential shrinking, but I'd say that 99% of the time they are correct.""</p> <p class="""">In curating a hoodie rundown that only has the best of the best, we searched high and low for products that met our standards.

His wife entered hospice care a few days before her death on Nov. 19. She also was diagnosed with dementia earlier this year.</p> <p class="""">When <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/politics/jimmy-carter-rosalynn-service-rcna127053"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Carter arrived at the ceremony</a>, he was photographed in a wheelchair with a blanket covering his legs. On it was a stitched image of the couple with the words ""The Carters.""</p> <p class="""">In a tender moment, one of the Carters' sons, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, 73, was photographed kissing his ailing father on the head. Jimmy Carter's family was concerned about him traveling over 150 miles to attend the services, the New York Times reported.</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter hasn't been seen much since entering hospice care some nine months ago. </p> <p class="""">His last public appearance took place about week prior to his <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/men-s-health/jimmy-carter-turns-99-healthy-habits-long-life-rcna117812"" target=""_blank"">99th birthday</a>.

In recent years especially, his health has made headlines, and his family has shared updates about his time in hospice care. Here's what to know about Jimmy Carter's health history.</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter today is living at home in hospice. He used to spend his days with his wife, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/rosalynn-carter-jimmy-carter-wife-dementia-rcna86873"" target=""_blank"">Rosalynn Carter, who was diagnosed with dementia</a> months before her death.</p> <p class="""">The couple's grandson Jason Carter, chairperson of the Carter Center's Board of Trustees, spoke in September about his grandparents' time together ""coming to the end."" </p> <p class="""">“He’s been in hospice now for several months, but they are happy,” he<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/14/jimmy-rosalynn-carter-coming-end/70851645007/"" target=""_blank""> told USA Today</a> at the time. “They are together. They are at home. They’re in love, and I don’t think anyone gets more than that. I mean, it’s a perfect situation for this time in their lives.”</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter faces ""really significant physical challenges,"" and he spends his time watching baseball and seeing family members, Jason Carter added.</p> <p class="""">Josh Carter, another of the former president's 11 surviving grandchildren, told <a href=""https://people.com/jimmy-rosalynn-carter-health-update-exclusive-7692868"" target=""_blank"">People</a> in August that his grandfather is in “the final chapter” of his life, but ""he's still fully Jimmy Carter.”</p> <p class="""">Although the former president is tired, Josh Carter said ""he fully understands (how many well wishes he’s received) and has felt the love.""</p> <p class="""">Josh Carter added that there's always someone at his grandparents' home, usually one of their four kids: Amy Carter, 56, John William ""Jack"" Carter, 76, James Earl ""Chip"" Carter III, 73, and Donnel Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Carter, 71. Recently, visitors to the home have only been caregivers and family, Josh Carter said.</p> <p class="""">He also said at the time his grandmother was ""still able to form new memories"" during her final months. </p> <p class="""">In February 2023, Jimmy Carter announced through his foundation, the Carter Center, that he'd be stopping medical intervention and only <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/politics/jimmy-carter-hospice-rcna71346"" target=""_blank"">receiving hospice care</a>. The news came after he'd survived a series of hospital stays.</p> <p class="""">Over the past several years, Jimmy Carter has survived cancer and multiple falls, among other illnesses.</p> <p class="""">In August 2015, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jimmy-carter-has-small-mass-removed-liver-expected-recover-n403236"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Carter underwent surgery</a> to remove a small mass from his liver.

Afterward, he continued to receive immunotherapy treatments.  </p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter has a family history with cancer. His father, brother and both of his sisters died of pancreatic cancer. His mother was also diagnosed with the disease, NBC News reported. </p> <p class="""">A few years later, during a 2019 church service, Jimmy Carter reflected on his cancer scare and the possibility he was going to die. <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/jimmy-carter-says-he-s-ease-death-during-church-service-t166371"" target=""_blank"">He said</a> he was “absolutely and completely at ease with death.”</p> <p class="""">“I assumed, naturally, that I was going to die very quickly,” he said. “I obviously prayed about it. I didn’t ask God to let me live, but I asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death, and I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death.”</p> <p class="""">In May 2019, Jimmy Carter <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/jimmy-carter-recovering-from-surgery-after-breaking-hip-59584581933"" target=""_blank"">fell at his Georgia home and broke his hip</a>. Shortly afterward, he underwent surgery.</p> <p class="""">The injury occurred when he was getting ready to leave for a turkey hunting trip.

Despite the injury and a black eye, he still traveled to Nashville to speak at a Habitat for Humanity event.</p> <p class="""">""I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital,"" <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/video/jimmy-carter-with-black-eye-and-stitches-makes-public-appearance-after-falling-70755397871"" target=""_blank"">he told the audience.</a> ""But I had a No. 1 one priority, and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.""That same month, Jimmy <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jimmy-carter-recovering-fractured-pelvis-after-fall-n1069896"" target=""_blank"">Carter suffered a fractured pelvis</a> from another fall at home.

The movie spawned two sequels, in 1986 and 1989, as well as the Netflix spinoff series ""Cobra Kai,"" which revisits the rivalry of Macchio's Daniel LaRusso and William Zabka's Johnny Lawrence, his antagonist in the first film.</p> <p class="""">Hilary Swank <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/cobra-kai-season-5-netflix-rcna46096"" target=""_blank"">also starred in 1994’s “The Next Karate Kid,”</a> which did not feature Macchio, but did see Pat Morita reprise his role from the first three movies as wise, soft-spoken karate master Mr. Miyagi.</p> <p class="""">Originating as a movie, becoming a TV show and then returning as a movie is about as rare as catching a fly with chopsticks, but it’s a move that speaks to the staying power of “The Karate Kid.” </p> <p class="""">The announcement of the new big-screen endeavor was heavy on hype, light on details. There was no plot revealed and Macchio and Chan directed people to a website if they’d like to be <a href=""https://sites.sonypictures.com/karatekidcasting/"" target=""_blank"">considered for the role</a> of the new “Karate Kid.” Right now, fans are ready to wax on wax off the deep end as they question what’s in store.</p> <p class="""">And we do indeed have questions. Here’s a look at what we’re wondering about the new movie.</p> <p class="""">Perhaps the most glaring issue is the most difficult to answer right now. “Cobra Kai” has been an Emmy-nominated success and there’s still <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/cobra-kai-renewed-season-6-last-season-rcna66627"" target=""_blank"">one more season</a> of the show scheduled to come out.</p> <p class="""">We have no idea what will happen in that final season and whether it will set the stage for the upcoming movie. And given that we know Chan will be involved in the film, is it a stretch to think he may take part in the final season of “Cobra Kai,” since showcasing key players from the movies has been a staple of the show? (More on that later.) </p> <p class="""">“Cobra Kai” has masterfully turned the idea of heroes and villains on its head, with many people thinking Johnny is the good guy while Daniel is the bad one. It’s an idea that had gained traction in the decades since “The Karate Kid” came out. </p> <p class="""">Does that provide any clues into the movie’s plot? Will the next generation of kids who star in “Cobra Kai” be involved? And where does Chan fit into all of this? Right now, we simply don’t know.</p> <p class="""">“Cobra Kai” has made sure to bring back several key supporting characters from the original film franchise. It's part of the show's charm and DNA.</p> <p class="""">From Martin Kove’s villainous <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/karate-kid-stars-explain-why-fans-love-cobra-kai-t191087"" target=""_blank"">Kreese</a> and Thomas Ian Griffith’s sadistic Terry Silver to Yuji Okumoto’s Chozen and Sean Kanan’s Mike Barnes, as well as love interests Tamlyn Tomita (Kumiko) and Robyn Lively (Jessica), the show has not skimped on revisiting characters fans love — and love to hate.</p> <p class="""">Even Elisabeth Shue <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/cobra-kai-has-amazing-surprise-will-leave-fans-cheering-t204988"" target=""_blank"">came back in an emotional return</a> during the third season that tied up loose ends. Could there be more juice squeezed from her appearance?</p> <p class="""">Morita, who earned a best supporting actor Academy Award nomination for the first “Karate Kid,” appeared in the two sequels, as well as “The Next Karate Kid,” before he died in 2005. He remains a vital part of the series’ universe and has been mentioned in “Cobra Kai.” While he can't star in the new movie, is it outlandish to think some of his wisdom will return in some capacity?</p> <p class="""">Speaking of returning in some capacity, the notion that Swank could pop up may sound ridiculous, but odds are you hadn't thought about the idea of Macchio and Chan coming together as their “Karate Kid” characters in the same movie, but that's happening, so who knows anymore? Ditto for Jaden Smith, who played the title character in the 2010 remake.</p> <p class="""">“Spider-Man” made waves by bringing in <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/tobey-maguire-andrew-garfield-tom-holland-spider-man-meme-rcna17510"" target=""_blank"">three different Spider-Men</a> in 2021's “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” so it’s not like there isn’t precedent. A new “Karate Kid” movie featuring multiple karate kids may seem far-fetched on the surface, but it really doesn’t sound too outrageous when you stop to think about it.</p> <p class="""">Take a ride in a time machine with us: It's 1989 and you're peeling Jujubes out of your teeth while leaving your local cineplex after seeing “The Karate Kid Part III.” You feel pretty confident that the poorly received film (<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/why-karate-kid-part-iii-best-film-trilogy-t156909"" target=""_blank"">but not by everybody</a>) will mark the final installment in the series and you'll be satisfied spending the rest of your days watching the first two ""Karate Kid"" movies on your VCR after you've taped them on cable. Boy, were you wrong.</p> <p class=""endmark"">You could've had the same sentiment after the 2010 remake. Or perhaps you thought it again when hearing “Cobra Kai” would be wrapping up. “The Karate Kid”? It's more like the karate cat because this property has many lives, so don't be surprised if there are more stories to be told.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Drew Weisholtz is a reporter for TODAY Digital, focusing on pop culture, nostalgia and trending stories.

In recent weeks, the variant has slowly increased in the U.S. and now joins HV.1 and EG.5 as one of the most prevalent strains in the country.</p> <p class="""">Pirola initially made headlines this summer when it was detected in the U.S. because it has multiple genetic differences that set it apart from the previous versions of the virus, according to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/covid-19-variant-update-2023-08-30.html"" target=""_blank"">the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p> <p class="""">BA.2.86 features more than 30 mutations compared to omicron XBB.1.5, which was the dominant variant for most of 2023 — it's also the strain targeted in the<a href=""https://www.today.com/health/cdc-new-covid-booster-side-effects-rcna104404"" target=""_blank""> updated COVID-19 vaccine</a>.</p> <p class="""">Last month, BA.2.86 barely made up 1% of cases in the U.S. but since early November, it has been driving a rising proportion of cases.</p> <p class="""">During a two-week period ending on Nov. 27, BA.2.86 accounted for nearly 9% of new COVID-19 infection in the U.S., according to the latest CDC <a href=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"" target=""_blank"">data</a>. However, these estimates are not exact, and the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/covid-19-variant-update-2023-11-27.html"" target=""_blank"">CDC said in a statement</a> on Monday that BA.2.86 is actually projected to account for 5-15% of currently circulating variants. </p> <p class="""">The <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/new-covid-variant-hv1-symptoms-rcna124198"" target=""_blank"">HV.1 subvariant</a> is still the dominant strain in the U.S. right now, accounting for 31% of cases during the same period. After HV.1, the next most common variant was <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/eris-eg5-covid-subvariant-symptoms-rcna98833"" target=""_blank"">EG.5</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/eris-eg5-covid-subvariant-symptoms-rcna98833"" target=""_blank"">,</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/eris-eg5-covid-subvariant-symptoms-rcna98833"" target=""_blank""> aka Eris</a>, which made up about 13% of cases, followed by JD.1.1, HK.3 and FL.1.5.1 or ""Fornax.""</p> <p class="""">Although the proportion of cases caused by BA.2.86 is going up, the CDC said that BA.2.86 does not appear to be driving increases in infections or hospitalizations in the U.S. at this time.</p> <p class="""">However, the variant has set off alarm bells in the past. In its initial <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/covid-19-variant.html"" target=""_blank"">risk assessment</a> of BA.2.86 published in August, the CDC said it may be more capable of bypassing existing immunity from COVID-19 vaccines or prior infection, but there is no evidence it causes more severe illness.</p> <p class="""">Recent laboratory data suggest that Pirola may be less contagious and immune-evasive than scientists once feared, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-covid-vaccine-2023-ba286-variant-moderna-rcna103603"" target=""_blank"">NBC News reported</a>. The new booster appears to provide protection against BA.2.86 and other new variants, the CDC said.</p> <p class="""">It's unclear whether BA.2.86 will become dominant in the U.S. or cause a surge in infections, but there's no reason to panic, experts say. The public health risk posed by BA.2.86 is still low, per the CDC. </p> <p class="""">However, cases of COVID-19 are expected to increase this winter as they have during the last few years, and the holidays present more opportunities for the virus to spread.</p> <p class="""">Here's what experts know so far about BA.2.86, aka Pirola, the symptoms it's causing, its ability to spread and how to protect against it.</p> <p class="""">BA.2.86, which health experts <a href=""https://twitter.com/TRyanGregory/status/1692552783243706718"" target=""_blank"">dubbed “Pirola”</a> on social media, was first detected in August in Israel and Denmark. It appears to have descended from the omicron BA.2 sublineage, which caused surges of the virus in early 2022, Andrew Pekosz, Ph.D., virologist at Johns Hopkins University, tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">“The critical thing about this variant (BA.2.86) is that it has a whole host of mutations compared to some of the omicron variants that emerged about two years ago,” says Pekosz. </p> <p class="""">Early data show BA.2.86 has 34 more mutations in its spike protein than <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/health/ba2-prepare-another-covid-19-surge-rcna2303"" target=""_blank"">BA.2, which drove a COVID surge</a> in 2022, and an additional 36 more mutations than <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/omicron-variant-xbb15-rcna64352"" target=""_blank"">omicron XBB.1.5</a>, which rapidly took over the U.S. in early 2023, according to an Aug. 24 paper in <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1964"" target=""_blank"">The BMJ</a>.</p> <p class="""">The mutations or changes in the virus sequence can affect how contagious a virus is, how well it responds to treatment and how severely it affects people, per the CDC.</p> <p class="""">“It represents a highly mutated form of SARS-CoV-2,” says Pekosz. In other words, BA.2.86 looks very different from the prevailing omicron XBB subvariants circulating. </p> <p class="""">At this time, it's not possible to know whether infection with BA.2.86 produces different symptoms from other variants, according to the CDC. ""The case numbers are just too small,"" Pekosz says.</p> <p class="""">In its risk assessment of BA.2.86, the CDC said ""there is no evidence that this variant is causing more severe illness,"" but like any variant, this could change as additional data comes in.</p> <p class="""">Common symptoms of other COVID-19 variants and subvariants include: </p> <p class="""">Based on what the CDC knows now about BA.2.86, existing tests and medications used to treat COVID-19 ""appear to be effective with this variant,"" the agency said.</p> <p class="""">The World Health Organization first classified BA.2.86 as a “variant under monitoring” on Aug. 17. Since then, BA.2.86 variant has been linked to over 6,300 cases in 47 countries, per the <a href=""https://gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/"" target=""_blank"">global virus database GISAID</a>. </p> <p class="""">The countries reporting the highest number of cases are the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, the United States, Spain and Canada.</p> <p class="""">So far, there have been an estimated 540 cases reported in at least 30 states in the U.S. in either people or wastewater, per GISAID and the CDC. Although the first human cases were detected in August, BA.2.86 was likely circulating in the U.S. before the end of July 2023, the CDC said in an <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7243a2.htm?s_cid=mm7243a2_w"" target=""_blank"">Oct. 27 report</a>.</p> <p class="""">“The variant is probably spreading much more broadly than we’ve detected so far,” says Pekosz, adding that a lack of testing and sequencing is likely causing a delay in reporting.</p> <p class="""">Right now, it's too early to tell whether BA.2.86 is more transmissible than other variants, says Pekosz. ""It's impossible to gauge anything about transmissibility or disease severity from that (small number of cases),"" he adds.</p> <p class="""">However, based on what we know about the genetic sequence of BA.2.86 and the mutations in its spike protein, the variant will likely be able to escape preexisting immunity to COVID-19, Pekosz says. </p> <p class="""">The CDC echoed this in its BA.2.86 risk assessment, which stated that the variant could be more capable of causing infection in people who previously had COVID-19 or got vaccinated.</p> <p class="""">""Most of the mutations that we find in the spike protein are probably going to affect the ability of antibodies to bind and neutralize the virus,"" Pekosz adds. </p> <p class="""">In other words, BA.2.86 could escape not only immunity from vaccination or prior infection up until this point, but also vaccine-induced immunity from the coming fall vaccine, Pekosz adds.</p> <p class="""">In <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7243a2.htm?s_cid=mm7243a2_w"" target=""_blank"">report published on Oct. 27</a>., the CDC said more “real-world human outcome data” are needed to better understand the impacts of pre-existing immunity for BA.2.86.</p> <p class="""">""That's why this variant is very concerning to us from a scientific standpoint,"" he adds. ""We need more sequences and cases to understand the variant's transmissibility.""</p> <p class="""">According to the CDC, laboratories are currently researching the antibody neutralization of BA.2.86 to better understand how the immune system may interact with the virus. </p> <p class="""">“We really don’t know if BA.2.86 will lead to increased numbers of cases,” Pekosz says. ""The sequence can’t tell us how much disease the virus will cause, nor can it tell us how well it’s spreading,"" says Pekosz. Only time and more data will tell.</p> <p class="""">BA.2.86 did not drive the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-summer-surge-2023-rcna100602"" target=""_blank"">late summer surge</a> in cases and hospitalizations in the U.S., <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/signs-point-rise-covid-rcna103439"" target=""_blank"">experts told NBC News</a>. This was likely driven by a combination of EG.5 and other <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/omicron-subvariants-reflect-viral-evolution-steroids-rcna53072"" target=""_blank"">omicron variants</a>. </p> <p class="""">Pirola is not currently driving an increase in infections, though the proportion of cases it's causing is expected to rise in the coming months, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/covid-19-variant-update-2023-11-27.html"" target=""_blank"">the CDC said</a>.</p> <p class="""">Nationwide, COVID hospitalizations appear to be trending upwards. In the last two weeks, average daily hospitalizations in the U.S. increased by 8.8%, according to an <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/covid-hospitalizations-see-latest-trend-current-count-rcna61053"" target=""_blank"">NBC News analysis</a>. However, BA.2.86 does not appear to be responsible for a rise in hospitalizations, the CDC said.</p> <p class="""">CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen said that cases are expected to increase this fall and winter.</p> <p class="""">In September, federal health officials approved a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/cdc-new-covid-booster-side-effects-rcna104404"" target=""_blank"">new COVID-19 booster</a> to roll out this fall. The updated vaccines for 2023-2024 are recommended by the CDC for everyone ages 6 months and older. </p> <p class="""">Doses are widely available at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and community clinics around the country. The CDC encourages everyone eligible to get at least one dose of the updated vaccine to protect against serious outcomes of COVID-19 this fall and winter. </p> <p class="""">However, uptake of the shot has been low so far, TODAY.com previously reported.</p> <p class="""">Right now, there are three vaccine options authorized by the FDA. These include two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for everyone ages 6 months and older, as well as a protein-based shot from Novavax for everyone ages 12 and older.</p> <p class="""">Manufacturers have reformulated the vaccines to protect against the omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant, which was the dominant strain circulating for most of 2023. </p> <p class="""">It has since been overtaken by other strains, but the updated COVID-19 vaccine appears to generate a strong immune response against BA.2.86, and experts anticipate the shots will provide cross-protection against newer strains circulating this winter, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/cdc-new-covid-booster-side-effects-rcna104404"" target=""_blank"">TODAY.com previously reported</a>. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Clinical-Trial-Data-Confirm-Its-Updated-Covid-19-Vaccine-Generates-Strong-Immune-Response-in-Humans-Against-BA.2.86/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Moderna</a><a href=""https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Clinical-Trial-Data-Confirm-Its-Updated-Covid-19-Vaccine-Generates-Strong-Immune-Response-in-Humans-Against-BA.2.86/default.aspx"" target=""_blank""> said that clinical trial data</a> confirmed its new vaccine ""showed an 8.7 to 11-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against circulating variants, including BA.2.86."" </p> <p class="""">The boosters are well-matched to the other strains currently making people sick, says Pekosz — and they will still be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization, per the CDC — so it's important for people to stay up to date with COVID vaccines. </p> <p class="""">The CDC is encouraging everyone eligible get the shot, especially those at higher risk, which includes people over the age of 65, those with underlying health conditions and the immunocompromised.</p> <p class=""endmark"">In addition to vaccination, people can protect themselves against COVID-19 by taking precautions such as wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, avoiding sick people and maintaining good hand hygiene.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Caroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Kelce has made one thing very clear: He's pretty smitten with the pop star. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/travis-jason-kelce-brothers-facts-rcna126014"" target=""_blank"">The Kansas City Chiefs tight end's </a>first attempt to woo the singer didn't go so well. He shared on his ""New Heights"" podcast, which he co-hosts with brother Jason Kelce, that he failed to slip Swift his number at one of her concerts. However, their romance certainly seems to be blooming now.</p> <p class="""">As their love story continues to unfold, here's a list of everything Kelce has said about Swift so far.  </p> <p class="""">Kelce's Chiefs play their home games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. When Swift's ""Eras Tour"" stopped by Arrowhead in July 2023, Kelce was in attendance and he hatched a plan to give the singer his phone number. </p> <p class="""">Inspired by a song lyric, friendship bracelets were a staple at the ""Eras Tour,"" with people handing out custom versions. Kelce explained he made a <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-phone-number-rcna96445"" target=""_blank"">friendship bracelet with his digits on it</a> on the July 26 episode of ""New Heights,"" but she didn't receive it.</p> <p class="""">“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” he said.</p> <p class="""">Despite his disappointment, Kelce said he still had a blast at the concert. </p> <p class="""">“She doesn’t meet anybody or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal. But it was an unbelievable show,” he said. </p> <p class="""">On Aug. 2, 2023, an NFL Network reporter asked Kelce about Swift during an interview. The tight end began laughing.</p> <p class="""">“I said what I said,” he replied, referencing his previous comment about the friendship bracelet. “And I meant what I said when I said it.""</p> <p class="""">Kelce then played coy and declined to comment on any rumored romance. </p> <p class="""">“You know, what? It is what it is. I’m not going to talk about my personal life. I know what you writers want to hear. And you want to hear more about that, and I’m not going to give you anything,” he said.</p> <p class="""">Kelce appeared on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Sept. 21 and revealed that he'd <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-dating-rumors-rcna111451"" target=""_blank"">invited Swift to attend a Kansas City Chiefs game.</a> </p> <p class="""">“I threw the ball in her court. I told her, I’ve seen you rock a stage in Arrowhead and you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,” he said. “We’ll see what happens in the near future.”</p> <p class="""">She <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/taylor-swift-chiefs-games-appearances-rcna126167"" target=""_blank"">ended up coming to the Sept. 24 game</a>, the first of many stadium appearances. During the Sept. 27 episode of his podcast, Kelce <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/travis-kelce-talks-taylor-swift-chiefs-game-leaving-getaway-car-rcna117558?"" target=""_blank"">applauded Swift </a>for showing up to his football game over the weekend. <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-timeline-rcna105483"" target=""_blank""> </a></p> <p class="""">“Shout out to Taylor for pulling up that was pretty ballsy,” he said. “I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. You know, the friends and family. She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.”</p> <p class="""">When asked about the time he'd been spending with Swift and how he's handling all the paparazzi attention <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-paparazzi-rcna119284"" target=""_blank"">during a press conference Oct. 6</a>, Kelce offered the following response </p> <p class="""">“As all the attention comes, it feels like I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl and right now, even more on top of the world. So it’s fun,” he said.</p> <p class="""">Kelce added that he's ""rolling with"" all the increased attention from fans and members of the media alike. </p> <p class="""">“We’re learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place. But at the same time, it comes with it,” he said. “You got a lot of people that care about Taylor for good reason. You just got to keep living and learning and enjoying the moments. At the end of the day, I’ve always been pretty good at compartmentalizing and being able to stay focused in this building.”</p> <p class="""">During one of Swift's appearances at a Kansas City Chiefs game, Kelce's father <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/dads/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-dad-ed-kelce-rcna121027?"" target=""_blank"">spent some time in the box with the pop star.</a> The tight end talked about their encounter on his podcast and said he was nervous.</p> <p class="""">“This is a terrifying conversation,” Kelce joked about dad talking to Swift. “I felt terrible. I felt terrible for Taylor.”</p> <p class="""">All teasing aside, Kelce said he has the “best f--- dad in the world” and explained that his father was ""just absolutely pumping (Swift) up.""</p> <p class="""">“He started listening to her music a little more,"" he said.</p> <p class="""">During one of his New York City outings with Swift, Kelce was seen taking over for a security guard and opening the singer's door. Social media users were quick to debate if the football player had pushed the guard or gently nudged him. Kelce addressed the topic during an episode of his podcast.</p> <p class="""">“I didn’t push him,” <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-security-rcna120990?"" target=""_blank"">he said.</a> “I placed my hand on the gentleman’s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me.”</p> <p class="""">Kelce went on to compliment Swift's security team.</p> <p class="""">“I’ll tell you what — they’re great. They’re great. They’re good people,” he said. </p> <p class="""">Kelce added that he does like to protect whoever he's dating.</p> <p class="""">“I feel like whenever I’m on a date I’m always having the sense of, like, I’m a man in the situation. I’m like protective. Yeah, for sure. You always kind of have that feeling or that self-awareness, I guess,” he said.</p> <p class="""">At a <a href=""https://www.chiefs.com/video/kansas-city-chiefs-tight-end-travis-kelce-press-conference-week-7-chargers"" target=""_blank"">press conference</a> on Oct. 20, Kelce suggested that he's switching up his look now that he's met Swift and said his mustache is ""slowly starting to disappear.""</p> <p class="""">“I’ll tell you what, man, that ‘stache and the 87 jersey was pretty iconic there for a little bit, and I had it when I met Taylor for the first time,” he said.</p> <p class="""">Over the summer, Kelce also addressed his facial hair in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl1hM5ilwIk"" target=""_blank"">Aug. 31 episode of “New Heights.”</a> At the time, he suggested that Swift would love his mustache.</p> <p class="""">“Yeah, we’re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode, but something tells me she’s going to like it,” he said at the time.</p> <p class="""">Kelce flew to Buenos Aires to see Swift perform on the international leg of her ""Eras Tour"" in November. When she <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/travis-kelce-reacts-taylor-swifts-chiefs-lyric-change-rcna125271"" target=""_blank"">changed the lyrics to her song ""Karma""</a> to reference him, the football player had a memorable reaction.</p> <p class="""">Javi Gutiérrez, a reporter in Argentina, took a video of the moment and shared it with TODAY.com. In the clip, Kelce smiles, claps and blows a kiss at the stage after hearing the following lyrics: “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs / Coming straight home to me.”</p> <p class="""">During an episode of his podcast, Kelce addressed the viral moment. </p> <p class="""">“I had no clue — well, I might’ve had a little bit of a clue, but definitely, when I heard it come out of her mouth, it still shocked me,” he said. “I was like, ‘Oh, shh,’ she really just said that, alright.”</p> <p class="""">Kelce also spoke highly of Swift's performance during the podcast episode. </p> <p class="""">“I was enjoying myself down there in Buenos Aires. The show was even more electric knowing that I had a little bit more to enjoy it for, and yeah, Taylor absolutely ripped it. She killed it and it looked like she was having some fun out there,” he said.</p> <p class="""">When Swift had to postpone one of her shows in Argentina due to weather conditions, she and Kelce dined at their hotel in Buenos Aires. During the Nov. 15 episode of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/jason-travis-kelce-podcast-new-heights-rcna121770"" target=""_blank"">his podcast</a>, the Chiefs player shared some details about <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-dinner-argentina-rcna125832"" target=""_blank"">the meal they shared.</a></p> <p class="""">“It was the first night I was there. Really the only night we had a chance to go to dinner was the night the show got postponed,” he said. “So we didn’t want to just go and have a blast throughout the city like we didn’t care about the show, so we made sure we stayed in the hotel and kind of kept to ourselves.” </p> <p class="""">Kelce went on to say they ordered empanadas and steak. </p> <p class="""">Kelce opened up like never before in <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/travis-kelce-dating-taylor-swift-wsj-magazine-rcna125990?"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> with WSJ Magazine</p> <p class="""">Kelce lavished praise on <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/taylor-swift-backup-dancer-brother-travis-kelce-teammate-rcna120770"" target=""_blank"">Swift </a>and called her ""hilarious"" and ""a genius."" </p> <p class="""">""Obviously I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them. I’ve never dealt with it,"" he said. ""But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it ... The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.""</p> <p class="""">Kelce also shed light on the origin of their relationship, saying ""somebody playing Cupid"" within Swift's family, without naming, exactly, who.</p> <p class="""">He also shared some details about their first date. </p> <p class="""">“When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there,” he said.</p> <p class="""">While commenting on her lyrical talent, Kelce offered the following thoughts on Swift. </p> <p class="""">""I’ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f—ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day,"" he said.</p> <p class="""">Kelce recently <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/philadelphia-eagles-jason-kelce-christmas-album-rcna121512"" target=""_blank"">teamed up with his brother</a>, who plays for the Philadelphia Eagles, to record a holiday song titled ""Fairytale of Philadelphia.” It quickly went to the No. 1 spot on the iTunes chart and Kelce thanked Swift's fans for helping propel the song to such success. </p> <p class=""endmark"">“Thanks, Taylor,” Kelce said. “Appreciate you and thank you to the Swifties.

""When I get out of the shower, I slather that on and I slather that on before I go to bed.""</p> <p class="""">As a singer and performer, she says that these lozenges (which were developed by another Broadway singer) are one of the things that she uses to help her prep for a show. ""These things are sugar-free, but they taste good. They have different flavors, my favorite is green apple. So think about a green apple Jolly Rancher, if you will. It's like that, but it has glycerin, so it helps the throat keep moisturized. And I don't go anywhere without them."" </p> <p class="""">“I’m a fan of the [Command] clear hooks because you can’t see them. And there are ones that are clear hooks for lights. They’re great, they hold the lights beautifully and you can’t see them. So those are great gifts and a great gift for yourself.” </p> <p class="""">As an ""avid reader"" who loves autobiographies, Chenoweth says that she's recently been loving Reba McEntire's book, ""Not That Fancy."" ""It has great easy, easy recipes in it, so [for] people like me who don't love to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, it's really fun. But all her anecdotes are just hilarious. She's an Okie like me.""</p> <p class="""">""This might be nerdy, but I love 7-Eleven and I love <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/ugly-shoe-trend-t292634"" target=""_blank"">Crocs</a>,"" she says, so the brands' limited-edition collab was right up her alley. ""But <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/crocs-brooklyn-wedge-sandals-review-t289486"" target=""_blank"">Crocs are back</a>. I also got the Barbie Crocs. People, those are comfortable, they're great for your feet, get them.""</p> <p class=""""><em>Editor’s note: While the 7-Eleven collaboration is now sold out, you can get the brand’s bestselling classic clog.</em></p> <p class="""">Chenoweth wants to make sure your <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-pet-products-t268105"" target=""_blank"">furry friends</a> aren't forgotten either. ""My dog is like my child, so I'm a really big fan of Badlands Ranch Dog Food. It's very organic, great for your pet, and I give them to Thunder. Their Super Bites chicken fo<a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/best-pet-products-t268105"" target=""_blank"">o</a>d is what I give her ... she loves it every time I feed her.""</p> <p class="""">Don't forget about the accessories! ""I just got sent two dog necklaces — not collars, necklaces ... If people have pets, there is a new company named Scarlett Dog Designs, you can go on their website and order what you like and they're so cute. So that's good for your pet.""</p> <p class="""">Chenoweth says that she's a ""big cozy person"" and one of her favorite brands for comfy essentials is Aviator Nation. ""I love the sweats and sweatshirts, all of them are super soft, as soft on the inside as they are on the outside. So I'm a big Aviator Nation fan and that would be a great Christmas gift for anybody.""</p> <p class="""">One way to make any piece of clothing or a similar gift feel even more special? By bedazzling it, of course. ""I have all my sports teams, all my sweatshirts bedazzled,"" she says. ""I like my shoes bedazzled, sometimes purses, pants."" For that, she turns to her go-to custom bedazzler, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/officialhausofcrystals/"" target=""_blank"">Haus of Crystals</a>. ""She's amazing, she's been bedazzling for me for several years and she does anything. She really does great if you have something that you're like, I'm never going to find that bedazzled, she'll bedazzle it.""</p> <p class=""endmark"">""I just recently bought something that's really cool. It's a backpack, it's neoprene — the material — and it's bright pink, but that's my taste. The company is called Dagne Dover,"" she says. ""I have a bad neck and when I want to carry a bunch of crap around, sometimes I need to in the city, it's so lightweight and they're really sturdy.""</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Emma Stessman is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

We worked together at the local newspaper and had been friends before falling for each other. It was our first Christmas as a couple, so we didn’t have any decorations in our cute little townhouse. We bought a few ornaments from the drugstore and hung them on the fake house plant that he had brought into our relationship. (When we got engaged a year later, the plastic plant magically disappeared. As did his ugly blue couch.)</p> <p class="""">Instead of buying gifts for each other, we decided to increase our paltry assortment of decorations. We’d both <a href=""https://www.today.com/style/joanna-gaines-shares-family-ornament-tradition-she-got-chip-s-t145094"" target=""_blank"">get the other an ornament </a> representing something significant from that year. It would be a fun surprise on Christmas Day.</p> <p class="""">I scoured the mall for the perfect ornament. That year, he worked double duty as both an assistant editor and columnist, putting in long hours every day. It was a good thing we worked in the same office because that’s where we both spent most of our time.</p> <p class="""">At a kiosk that sold personalized ornaments, I found what I was looking for: a bear typing at his computer. I had my beloved’s name painted on it.</p> <p class="""">His gift to me: A miniature old-school newspaper box which, when you pushed it, would pop out a tiny mouse holding a newspaper.</p> <p class="""">On Christmas morning, we laughed about the fact that both of our ornaments reflected our work-centric lives.</p> <p class="""">One year later, we were engaged to be married and made the decision to move from Delaware to Florida. We moved the day after Christmas, but still exchanged ornaments. He got me a delicate wire ‘Delaware’ state ornament. I got him a wooden yellow sun, to represent our life ahead in the Sunshine state.</p> <p class="""">And so it was established, the one — and only — tradition we have kept in our 25 years of marriage. My aversion to plastic house plants has diminished, partly because I love a good fake Christmas tree. <a href=""https://www.today.com/home/why-my-fake-christmas-tree-better-your-real-one-t61936"" target=""_blank"">I put up three in our house every December,</a> and one is 8 feet tall and filled with the ornaments that we have exchanged. I call it our memories tree.</p> <p class="""">Each year when we decorate it, they come flooding back.</p> <p class="""">In 1998, we found out a few weeks before Christmas that we were expecting our first child. He gave me a beautiful glass ornament that said “Curiosity Shop.” Under the windows, he wrote: “Boy? Girl? Twins?” We had a girl nine months later. My ornament next Christmas was a minivan that said, “Future soccer mom.” (Our girl did become a soccer player, and I drove many a soccer carpool! How prescient was that?)</p> <p class="""">All of our life transitions, travels and even some trials hang on that tree. Our first house is represented by a sweet little house ornament with the numbers 444 (our house number) over the door. The year we visited friends in France is remembered with a bear wearing a chef's hat drinking wine. In fact, the year I started a new job — this job — is reflected by a computer with the old-school “TODAY Moms” logo, the predecessor to TODAY Parents.</p> <p class="""">There are years we gave each other the same ornament. Which means there are two Statues of Liberty on the tree and two Big Ben ornaments, memories of trips to New York and London.</p> <p class="""">There are memories of the sports our kids played. “An undefeated Scorpions season,” reads the back of a baseball glove, a reminder of one of my son’s little league teams that my husband coached.</p> <p class="""">There are memories of moments that were scary at the time, but funny in retrospect. One summer on vacation, we got caught in a bad current while tubing down a river. The ornament: a canoe (I couldn't find an inner tube!) with the words, “Near-death experience on the Wenatchee River” written on the bottom. This year when hanging it, I noticed both paddles on the canoe had broken off. How appropriate.</p> <p class="""">Our kids, ages 24 and 21, give us both ideas about what we should get to surprise the other. And I hope it’s a tradition they will continue when they have families of their own.</p> <p class="""">Every year after New Year’s Day when I pack up our tree, I attempt to catalog the ornaments by year and memory… because as time goes on, ornaments are broken, memories fade. I add to the list each year but it isn't completed. This year marks our 28th year, which means there are 56 ornaments to account for.</p> <p class=""endmark"">That first ornament I gave my husband, the one of the worker bear sitting at a computer, is still there, though his name is almost peeled off. He’s still as hard-working as ever. That ornament might be my favorite, a memory of one of the best decisions I ever made.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

The candle itself is vegan and all-natural, but the sentiment is all in the card. Leave a short poem, an admiring declaration or any sweet notes for your special someone (up to 20 words). The Gift of Love candle is scented with rose and geranium essential oils to uplift and inspire, and has a burn time of up to 50 hours. </p> <p class="""">The last day for customized orders is December 17, so we suggest placing an order as soon as you can. </p> <p class=""""><strong>More Handmade Habitat options available:</strong></p> <p class="""">Tis’ the season for hosting! For the entertainer in your life, this wood and marble cheese board is an elegant base for any charcuterie, appetizers, cheeses and other delicacies. The carefully carved corners and optional monogrammed center detail (up to three letters for an additional $12) also make this a wonderful centerpiece for holiday feasts. Opt for the small ($45) or large size ($59) in either white or charcoal marble.

Since the canister itself is white, you can either add a pop of color in the font or keep it simple. Personalization comes with the price. </p> <p class="""">If you order by 12/22 with expedited shipping, you can get this order on time for Christmas. </p> <p class="""">What we appreciate most about fanny packs is that you can wear them in various ways: slung over the shoulder, across the shoulder or around the hips. It’s one of the many reasons why they’ve become a popular gift this year. This one from the female-founded brand, State Bags, has sold out multiple times because of this versatility, along with its two spacious compartments. And since it is made with nylon, cleaning should be simple. </p> <p class="""">To personalize this fanny pack, you have the option to add up to six initials for an extra $20. </p> <p class="""">Your work and/or book bag should adapt to your schedule, not the other way around.

From monogramed water bottles to hand-painted portraits, there’s a little bit of something for every personality.</p> <p class="""">Post adores this brand because of one simple fact: “Supermix Studio is the first interactive kids clothing brand where children can design and customize their own one-of-a-kind clothing and accessories,” including this oversized jacket. It’s a unique way for them to showcase their personality and creative side, as there are over 400 patches on the site that your little one can choose from, ranging from letters to smiley faces. </p> <p class="""">If you want to gift this or another style to the kid in your life, Supermix Studio is offering $75 gift cards for just $59, if you design and order now or through December 25. </p> <p class=""""><strong>More Supermix Studio options available:</strong></p> <p class="""">Here’s another personalized gift Post is a major fan of — she even owns three for her family, and calls the concept “so wonderful to capture your family in silhouette for generations to come!” These portraits are all hand-painted by the award-winning artist himself, who gives you full reign to choose the color, size and caption on your selected portrait. This can work on your kid, a grandparent and even a family pet!</p> <p class="""">Using the code <strong>TODAY</strong>, Kustera is offering viewers a 50% discount on any size “Unframed” portraits through 12/1.

It’s lightweight and spacious enough to hold the essentials, such as your phone, keys and wallet, with enough room to spare smaller items. Wear it across the chest or as a fanny pack for multiple ways of styling it. To top it off, you can monogram the bag (which comes in six colors, might we add) with your own or their initials for an additional $12.50. </p> <p class="""">But for 11/28 only, Mark &amp; Graham will be offering the following using code <strong>TODAY</strong>:</p> <p class="""">Now that it seems most people own a pair of wireless earbuds, Post says this is the perfect opportunity to help differentiate whose are whose.

Preppy Jones also gives you the option to choose from two to three initials in 49 shades.

Use it to stash lip gloss, debit cards and other smaller items, and complete it with your design of choice. The pouch straps around most standard water bottles (40 oz, 20 oz and 30 oz) with the help of a velcro strap. </p> <p class="""">Stationary supplies should always be playful, and Post says these notepads are full of fun! You can make this notepad a stocking stuffer or bundled with the brand’s other personalized stationery items.

You can finally listen EVERYWHERE now,” she said on Instagram.</p> <p class="""">But a new detail shared by her producer has fans launching on a whole new string of theories about what drove Swift to write the song.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/jack-antonoff-margaret-qualleys-fiance-rcna100770"" target=""_blank"">Jack Antonoff</a>, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/taylor-swift-jack-antonoff-friendship-timeline-rcna120163"" target=""_blank"">Swift's close friend and collaborator</a>, also celebrated the streaming drop of the song, of which he served as a writer and producer. On Instagram Nov. 29, he revealed behind-the-scenes details about the track.</p> <p class="""">Antonoff posted a picture to Instagram stories of Swift wearing a sweater and eating raisins in a kitchen with a bottle of what appears to be wine.</p> <p class="""">""you're losing me is out today,"" he wrote over the picture. ""a very special track from the midnights sessions that's finally (streaming)! written and recorded at home on 12/5/21 right after taylor ate these raisins.""</p> <p class="""">While written in 2021, the track, a devastating song that chronicles the gradual end of a relationship, came out more than a year later in May 2023, shortly after reports of Swift’s <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-breakup-fan-reaction-rcna79627"" target=""_blank"">split from Joe Alwyn</a> surfaced. The timing of the original release led many to believe it was inspired by their breakup.

Both children have grown followings on Cohen's Instagram account, where he posts their family vacations, holiday celebrations and hilarious daily moments. </p> <p class="""">Now, Cohen is mulling the benefits of keeping his private life more private. He has stopped showing Ben's face on social media, often masking him with an emoji icon in photos, and is considering when to do the same for Lucy.</p> <p class="""">“The last time I showed Ben’s face (on social media) was when I got my star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,""<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/andy-cohen-reality-reckoning-exclusive-rcna126875"" target=""_blank""> he tells TODAY.com in an exclusive digital interview.</a> ""And Lucy, I’m teetering towards not showing anymore. I just feel funny about it. People need to understand that my kids are not me and they didn’t sign up for this.”</p> <p class="""">Cohen's own mother has strong feelings about her grandchildren's social media presence. </p> <p class="""">""I’m figuring it out as I go. My mom is really on me about it,"" he says. ""She’s really like, ‘You have to stop.’ She was very vocal about, ‘OK, you can’t show Ben anymore. When are you going to stop showing Lucy?’""</p> <p class="""">Having children helped Cohen understand the parents on Bravo's ""Housewives"" franchise. </p> <p class="""">“You can say a lot about the Housewives, but they’re great moms,” Cohen tells TODAY.com. </p> <p class="""">“One of the unexpected joys of my time with the Wives is that now, when we’re on breaks from reunions, we’re sitting there waiting, getting touched up and stuff, and we all talk about our kids and about parenting,"" he added. ""It’s opened up a portal to the way they parent that I never used to care about very much, frankly.”</p> <p class="""">Coming home to Ben and Lucy each day, says Cohen, is what matters to him. </p> <p class="""">""If I go on Twitter at any given moment, it’s a battlefield about politics, or people telling me that I messed up a show completely, or that I’m this, that, or the other,"" Cohen says. ""But Ben today: I was like, ‘Ben, I love you.’ He goes, ‘However many stars there are in the sky is how much I love you.’ And I’m set for the day. ... This little boy loves me for as many stars as there are? The rest doesn’t really matter!”</p> <p class="""">Last month, Cohen shared a pic from a father-daughter stroll complete with cozy layers, coffee and some sunshine. </p> <p class="""">""Fall stroll with my girl,"" he captioned <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyd3x4rOoxY/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"">the photo</a>.</p> <p class="""">The two have been having lots of adventures together lately.

Maybe Reese’s aren’t the thing to eat for breakfast.”</p> <p class="""">“Maybe I shouldn’t have picked them,” Ben said in a tiny voice. “I thought of them, so I picked them.”</p> <p class="""">Cohen captioned his post: ""Learning about repercussions. And what IS breakfast anyway???? An evolving conversation I’m having with Ben…."" </p> <p class="""">Cohen shares the serious moments of parenting along with the silly ones.</p> <p class="""">In May, he became emotional while recounting a story about a time he felt like he had failed his eldest child. </p> <p class="""">“Ben goes to a progressive nursery school in New York City. I’m the only single parent and I’m the only gay dad,” Cohen, 55, revealed during a conversation with <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/05/18/1176469899/andy-cohen-leila-fadel-talks-daddy-diaries-entertainment"" target=""_blank"">NPR</a>.

The CNN anchor is raising kids Wyatt, 3, and Sebastian, 18 months, with his former partner Benjamin Maisani. Ben and Wyatt are BFFs, and are often pictured together on Cohen's Instagram.</p> <p class="""">“Ben sees that Wyatt has two gay dads, and there are two gay dads down the hall from us,” Cohen shared with the <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/andy-cohen-still-loves-the-housewives"" target=""_blank"">“The New Yorker”</a> earlier this year.</p> <p class="""">Cohen also leans on friends and veteran moms Kelly Ripa and Sarah Jessica Parker when he needs advice. </p> <p class="""">“Kelly and Sarah Jessica have been really great because I can text them at any time, and be like, ‘Ben is constipated,’” Cohen told <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/dads/andy-cohen-shares-sarah-jessica-parker-helped-parent-rcna56364"" target=""_blank"">TODAY.com</a> in 2022. “Then I know immediately what to run out and get.”</p> <p class="""">“The Daddy Diaries” author is quick to note he’s happier than he’s ever been with Ben and Lucy in his life.</p> <p class="""">“I want to be everything for them,” Cohen<a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/dads/andy-cohen-single-parenthood-kids-ben-lucy-rcna83320"" target=""_blank""> told TODAY co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb in May</a>. “As a single parent, there is the feeling of ‘I need to be there,' and I’m always kicking myself for time not spent with them and trying to dissect what it all means and seeking out parent friends for advice.”</p> <p class="""">“But I wouldn’t change it for the world, by the way,” he added.</p> <p class="""">Read on to learn to learn more about Cohen's kids, Ben and Lucy.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/andy-cohen-welcomes-baby-boy-see-first-photo-father-son-t148096"" target=""_blank"">Cohen announced the birth of his son</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/andy-cohen-welcomes-baby-boy-see-first-photo-father-son-t148096"" target=""_blank"">,</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/andy-cohen-welcomes-baby-boy-see-first-photo-father-son-t148096"" target=""_blank""> Benjamin Allen</a>, with a sweet selfie on Instagram.</p> <p class="""">“He is named after my grandfather Ben Allen,” Cohen wrote, in part. “I’m in love.

Later that month, <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/new-dad-andy-cohen-opens-about-baby-benjamin-i-just-t149046"" target=""_blank"">Cohen opened up about fatherhood</a> to TODAY anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb. </p> <p class="""">“There is a comfort in knowing that he’s there waiting for me,” Cohen said.

It’s my family. I was like, ‘I love this feeling.’”</p> <p class="""">When Anderson Cooper welcomed his son Wyatt in 2020, the two boys became besties, just like their dads. </p> <p class="""">“We’ll get over there and Wyatt will be sleeping and Anderson will say, ‘Do you want to come into his room to wake him up with me?’"" Cohen told<a href=""https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-son-ben-playdates-anderson-cooper-son-wyatt-exclusive/"" target=""_blank""> People in 2021</a>. “And Ben’s like, ‘Yeah.’ And so they go in there and they wake them up and it’s really cute.</p> <p class="""">“Ben always gives Wyatt a hug and gives him a kiss,” Cohen added.</p> <p class="""">The following year, Cohen shared a photo of Ben and Wyatt sitting in the host chairs on the set of ""Watch What Happens Live.""</p> <p class="""">""New WWHL co-hosts Ben &amp; Wyatt are taking over my show. Thanks for a great run, Bravo!"" Cohen captioned the adorable photo.</p> <p class="""">Over the years, Cohen has treated his Instagram followers to relatable parenting content — <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/parents/andy-cohen-shares-another-relatable-clip-traveling-with-kids-rcna46399"" target=""_blank"">like the time Ben had a tantrum </a>during a drive home from a weekend getaway. </p> <p class="""">“You just watched ‘Bob the Builder’ for six hours while I packed the car up,” Cohen said as the little one continued his meltdown. “You can’t want to watch more.” </p> <p class="""">Ben disagreed. </p> <p class="""">“I do!” he whimpered.</p> <p class="""">""Bob the Builder,"" is just one of Ben's favorite things.

Dressed in a dark suit, his legs were covered by a blanket that featured a stitched photo of him and his late wife. Carter sat in the front row next to his daughter, Amy. </p> <p class="""">The former U.S. president — the oldest living commander-in-chief in the nation’s history — turned 99 on Oct. 1, a milestone that seemed impossible when he <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/politics/jimmy-carter-hospice-rcna71346"" target=""_blank"">entered hospice care</a> in February 2023.</p> <p class="""">Carter, who is a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/jimmy-carter-health-rcna100953"" target=""_blank"">cancer survivor</a> and had suffered a series of falls in recent years, decided to spend “his remaining time at home with his family” in Plains, Georgia, foregoing additional medical intervention after several hospital stays, The Carter Center said in a statement at the time.</p> <p class="""">“We thought at the beginning of this process that it was going to be in five or so days,” Jason Carter, his grandson, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/us/politics/jimmy-carter-hospice.html"" target=""_blank"">told The New York Times</a> in September 2023.</p> <p class="""">“I was down there with him in the hospital and then said goodbye. And then we thought it was going to be in that week that it was coming to the end. And it’s just now been seven months.”</p> <p class="""">A week before Carter turned 99, the former president made an appearance at the Plains Peanut Festival in Georgia, riding in a car with his wife, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/rosalynn-carter-jimmy-carter-wife-dementia-rcna86873"" target=""_blank"">Rosalynn</a>, on a beautiful fall day. He still likes peanut butter ice cream, The Carter Center <a href=""https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1705614230370541856"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>.</p> <p class="""">Such small joys are “invaluable” to keep a terminally ill patient going, says Dr. BJ Miller, a hospice and palliative medicine physician in San Francisco. He is not treating Carter.</p> <p class="""">""It’s important for the world to see how hospice should go, and that it’s not a scary thing. It’s not about death — it really is about <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-avoid-regret-what-doctor-wishes-people-knew-about-living-t160130"" target=""_blank"">living until you die</a>. I’m glad for (Carter) to be making this example,” Miller tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">Patients go into hospice when doctors believe they have six months or less to live, he notes. They’re no longer trying to “push back on the illness,” so the focus becomes comfort care to ease any suffering, Miller adds. That includes medicine to alleviate pain, nausea or anxiety. </p> <p class="""">It also means emotional support for the patient and their family, talking things through and trying to find meaning in their remaining time.</p> <p class="""">But it’s “not rare” that people live longer in hospice care than expected, like Carter, Miller says. He’s seen it many times in his own practice.</p> <p class="""">It’s very difficult for doctors to pinpoint how much time a terminally ill patient has left, so they’re always guessing, Miller notes.</p> <p class="""">Another reason is that hospice care can be a relief for a patient who’s been in and out of the hospital receiving aggressive medical treatment and taking countless medications.</p> <p class="""">“At some point, a lot of that effort can be fatiguing on the body, certainly emotionally draining and sometimes even demoralizing,” Miller says.</p> <p class="""">“(In hospice), you’re no longer being pulled all over the place to try this or that treatment. Finally, there’s some peace. Finally, there’s someone listening to your symptoms. And finally, you get to stay home and the care is coming to you.”</p> <p class="""">Sometimes people live longer in hospice than they would otherwise because of that “loving, de-stressing support,” he notes.</p> <p class="""">Carter is the first president to live until 95 or older and the only one to live to see the 40th anniversary of his inauguration.</p> <p class="""">Genes can play a role in longevity, but Carter has a complicated family medical history. His mother lived to be 85, but his father died at 58 of pancreatic cancer. Both his sisters and his brother also died of pancreatic cancer, and his mother had the disease as well, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/former-u-s-president-jimmy-carter-has-advanced-cancer-n408751"" target=""_blank"">NBC News reported.</a></p> <p class="""">In 2015, Carter was diagnosed with melanoma that had spread to his liver and brain. He received immunotherapy treatments and scans showed no evidence of the cancer within months. In 2019, he had a series of falls that led to broken bones and required surgery.</p> <p class="""">Still, the former president has made it to 99. Here are some of his healthy longevity habits:</p> <p class="""">Carter and his wife had famously gotten involved in the community, helping to build, renovate and repair more than 4,300 homes in 14 countries while <a href=""https://www.habitat.org/newsroom/2019/jimmy-and-rosalynn-carter-2020-habitat-humanity-work-project-take-place-dominican"" target=""_blank"">volunteering for Habitat for Humanity</a> since 1984. The work gave him joy, the <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/jimmy-carter-how-volunteering-gave-me-joy-wbna33312483"" target=""_blank"">former president wrote</a> in one of his books.</p> <p class="""">“Community involvement tells you that you want to live, you want to help other people,” Valter Longo, Ph.D., professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California and director of the USC Longevity Institute in Los Angeles, tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">“You have a reason to keep doing all the things that you need to do,” he notes, like going to the doctor, eating a healthy diet and exercising. “In the end, (it’s) whatever gets you out of bed.</p> <p class="""">Volunteering helps people stay engaged with others and contribute, Miller adds.</p> <p class="""">“You need to put love into the world and care in the world. And that, too, is a lifeblood,” he says.</p> <p class="""">Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/jimmy-carter-rosalynn-carter-relationship-timeline-rcna101205"" target=""_blank"">married for 77 years</a> — the longest-married couple in presidential history. Carter called it “a full partnership.”</p> <p class="""">“Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” Carter said in a <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/rosalynn-carter-wife-jimmy-carter-dies-rcna101020"" target=""_blank"">statement</a> when she died on Nov. 19. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.”</p> <p class="""">During Rosalynn Carter’s tribute service on Nov. 28, the couple's daughter, Amy Carter, <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/amy-carter-letter-rosalynn-carter-rcna127073"" target=""_blank"">read a love letter</a> the former president had written to his wife 75 years ago.</p> <p class="""">“My darling, every time I have ever been away from you, I have been thrilled when I returned to discover just how wonderful you are.

The former president also enjoys fly-fishing and woodworking, according to <a href=""https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/the-carters/jimmy-carter"" target=""_blank"">his biography</a>.</p> <p class="""">Exercise affects every cell in the body and is <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/new-science-shows-exercise-affects-nearly-every-cell-body-rcna10688"" target=""_blank"">vital for good health</a>, experts say.</p> <p class="""">Since leaving the White House in 1981 until 2020, Carter regularly <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/jimmy-carter-returns-teach-sunday-school-first-time-breaking-hip-t155911"" target=""_blank"">taught Sunday school</a> at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife attended services.</p> <p class="""">“Our religious beliefs are important to us,” the former president <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/jimmy-carter-how-volunteering-gave-me-joy-wbna33312483"" target=""_blank"">wrote in one of his books</a>.</p> <p class="""">Just like having a sense of purpose, religion can help people do the right things for their health and keep going, Longo says.</p> <p class="""">Faith can be a source of meaning and belonging, which is good for the body and soul, Miller adds.</p> <p class=""endmark"">“We can push and prod at the body to keep going in all sorts of ways. But if there’s no spark, if there’s no reason to live, if there’s no joy in living” it won't help much, he says.

The largest muscle in the body, the gluteus maximus, helps hold you upright and stabilizes the <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/hip-flexor-stretches-rcna16322"" target=""_blank"">hips</a>, making it essential to everyday movement. And yes, working all three glute muscles will help tighten and tone your butt. </p> <p class="""">The glute muscles are easy to target at home with no equipment. I’ve put together a list of the best butt exercises to build your backside by strengthening the glutes from every angle. Pick your favorites from the list and string them together for a killer butt workout! </p> <p class="""">The <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/try-bridge-yoga-pose-improve-your-posture-t232159"" target=""_blank"">glute bridge</a> will help you activate your glutes before starting your work out. Begin lying on the floor with your back on the ground and your arms at your sides. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the ground. Using your glutes, lift your back and butt off the floor and into the air. Make sure you’re fully engaging your glutes and not relying on any other muscles, like your legs, instead. If you allow your other muscles to take over, you’re not fully <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-glute-exercises-rcna16804"" target=""_blank"">activating your glutes</a>. Think about squeezing your butt to lift your body.</p> <p class="""">Start on your knees, and then extend your right leg straight out to the side. Lower your left hand down to the ground to the left of your body. Pull your abs in and relax your shoulders. Then lift the right leg up as high as your hip, and lower it back down. Repeat for 10 reps, and then switch sides.</p> <p class="""">Lying down on your stomach, open your arms and legs as wide as the mat or as wide as your shoulders. Pull your abs in, and then lift your right arm and left leg off of the ground, squeezing your left glute. Then switch and lift the left arm and right leg off of the ground, releasing your right arm and left leg. Continue moving back and forth quickly for 30 seconds.</p> <p class=""""> </p> <p class="""">Lying on your right side, prop your head up with your right hand. Extend your legs out on a slight diagonal in front of you. Then lift your left leg up a few feet toward the ceiling, working the left outer glute. Lower it back down. Repeat 10 times, then switch to the right side.</p> <p class="""">Begin the same as you would with a standard glute bridge: on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor in front of you. With this variation, start by keeping your left heel on the ground and raising your right leg straight up in the air. Squeeze the left glute and <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-hamstring-exercises-rcna17619"" target=""_blank"">hamstring muscles</a>, keeping your core activated as you lift your hips. Keeping your right leg raised, slowly lower your hips back to the floor. Repeat and then switch sides.</p> <p class="""">Place a chair behind you and stand in front of it with feet hips-width apart. Push the hips backward to begin squatting slowly until your butt taps the chair. Stand back up and repeat. The seated squat still successfully targets the muscles in your lower body while the chair serves as a safety for those who aren’t fully comfortable squatting or are still <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-do-squats-5-steps-perform-squat-properly-today-t208207"" target=""_blank"">mastering the form</a>.</p> <p class="""">For this exercise, you may want to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/15-minute-full-body-resistance-band-workout-t219311"" target=""_blank"">use a resistance band</a>, but you can also perform it with just your bodyweight! Begin standing in a half-squat position with the band around your ankles. Take a step toward your right, then follow with your left foot. Take two steps in one direction and then two steps in the other, squeezing your glutes with each step. If you don’t have a resistance band, that’s not a problem. With awareness, you can make sure that you’re truly squeezing your glutes with each step. This is another good exercise to help <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/9-exercises-warm-you-walk-or-run-cold-t206295"" target=""_blank"">wake up your butt muscles before a walk</a> or run. </p> <p class="""">This exercise fires up your glutes and then specifically targets the gluteus medius. It also works your balance in the standing leg as you do the side leg lift. Start standing with your feet as wide as your hips. Bend your knees and reach your glutes back as if you’re sitting into a chair, then as you stand up press down through the left foot as you lift the right leg out to the right as high as the hip. Feel the outside of the right<a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/hip-flexor-stretches-rcna16322"" target=""_blank""> hip tighten</a> as you lift. Then lower it back down into the standing position, repeat the squat, and perform a left side leg lift. Repeat 20 squats total; 10 side leg lifts on each side. </p> <p class="""">The clam targets your gluteus medius specifically, making it the perfect move to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/dead-butt-syndrome-5-exercises-help-activate-your-glutes-t210476"" target=""_blank"">combat dead butt syndrome</a>. The clam will also help with hip stabilization and range of motion. Lie down on your left side with your head resting on your arm or propped up on your forearm. Bend both of your knees, stacking them on top of each other and pull them up closer to your torso. Keep the bottom leg resting on the floor while lifting the other into the air, opening your hips. Keep your feet glued together the entire time. This should activate your right glute. After ten repetitions, flip over to lie on your right side and repeat the same process. Again, make sure you are not involving other muscles that may make this process easier. Squeeze your glutes — and even <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/resistance-band-strength-workout-plan-t243751"" target=""_blank"">add a resistance band</a> around your thighs for extra glute activation! </p> <p class="""">This exercise involves a similar type of movement as the clamshell, which means it also directly targets the gluteus medius. Start on all fours with your hands and knees on the ground. Keeping your right knee bent, lift your right leg out toward the side of your body until your leg is parallel with the floor. Repeat this motion ten times before switching to your other leg.</p> <p class="""">The donkey kick engages your glutes in a backward motion of the legs. It’s important to make sure you’re not relying on your quads for help during this exercise as it’ll hinder glute activation. Begin on all fours. Keep your knee bent at a 90-degree angle and lift your right leg backward until your your thigh is aligned with your back, keeping your foot flexed. Think of stamping the ceiling with the bottom of your foot. Lower your leg back down and back up in a continuous motion. Repeat ten times, then switch legs and repeat.</p> <p class="""">Perform the donkey kick, reaching the right leg up toward the ceiling. Then once you come back to center, immediately open the right knee to the side into the fire hydrant. Repeat this 10 times before switching sides.</p> <p class="""">Start standing with feet hips-width apart. Step your right foot out to the right. Bend the right knee and reach the right glute back into a side <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-do-a-lunge-rcna32739"" target=""_blank"">lunge</a>. Keep the left leg straight. Press down through the right heel to come back to center. Perform 10 repetitions and then repeat on the left side.</p> <p class="""">Start standing with feet hips-width apart. Move the right leg out to the right, pointing the right toe and resting it on the ground. Then engage the glute and hip to lift the right leg up almost as high as the hip. Lower it down and repeat for 10 repetitions before switching sides.</p> <p class="""">Start standing straight. As you step to the right, cross the left foot behind the right to tap the ground behind the right foot. At the same time, swing your arms like an ice skater. Then, step to the left and bring the right foot behind the left to tap the ground as you swing your arms. For an added challenge, turn the step side to side into a jump.</p> <p class="""">Standing with your feet as wide as your hips, step your right foot back into a reverse <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-do-a-lunge-rcna32739"" target=""_blank"">lunge</a>. Lower the right knee down toward the floor and bend the left knee over the left ankle. Press down through the left heel to step the right leg back to center. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides.</p> <p class="""">Start standing with the feet as wide as the hips. Then point the right leg back behind you. Lift the right leg straight up toward the ceiling, squeezing the glute, and then lower it down. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet as wide or wider than your shoulders and turn your toes out. Pull your abs in and bend your knees out to the sides as you lower down into a wide squat. Keep your back straight and your pelvis tucked under. At the bottom, come up onto your tip toes and balance for one second. Then press the heels back down into the ground and drive up to a standing position. Start with 3-5 repetitions total and build from there.</p> <p class="""">Start standing with your feet as wide as your shoulders. Step your right foot back behind and slightly to the left of your left foot. Bend both knees as you lower down into a lunge in this curtsy position. Then press down through your left heel to bring your right leg back to center. Repeat 10 times and then switch to the other side.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed forward. (As you move through the exercise, be mindful that your knees never go forward past your toes.) Keep your chest up and make sure not to tilt your head down. Pull your navel in toward your spine to <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/core-exercises-t249057"" target=""_blank"">engage your core</a>. Bend the knees while keeping your heels and toes on the floor, slowly sitting back into a squat position with your chest up, your shoulders back and abs in. Lower down until your knees are bent at as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. Then straighten your legs by pressing into your heels to stand back up. Squeeze your glutes at the top, tilting your pelvis forward. Repeat.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet as wide as your hips. Put your weight into your left leg and begin to hinge at your waist, keeping your left knee soft. Place your hands on your hips for balance. Continue to hinge forward and lift your right leg up and back until your body forms a straight line from head to toe. Ensure that your hips stay square to the ground. Pause, and then return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet as wide as your hips. Bend your knees and reach your butt back. Sink down low toward the ground in this narrow squat position and look down to ensure your knees aren’t further forward than your toes. From here.

Open your legs as wide as the hips and bend the knees, bringing the heels together with the toes apart. Pull the naval away from the ground to engage your core.

I remember making a huge mess with my cousins in my grandmother’s kitchen, blasting <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/mariah-carey-christmas-tradition-twins-rcna123935"" target=""_blank"">Mariah Carey’s</a> Christmas album on loop. The resulting cookies were always…edible, at the very least. We’d pack them into tins where they’d sit and get stale until we presented them to our parents who tried their best to gulp them down on <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/christmas-eve-dinner-ideas-t270842"" target=""_blank"">Christmas Eve</a>. Eventually, my sister and I were recruited to bake cookies with a family friend who taught us how to make cookies that actually tasted as good as they looked.</p> <p class="""">Then during my teen years, my high school friends organized a secret Santa, which always culminated in a gift exchange at one friend’s house. For weeks, her mom turned her house into a cookie factory, making dozens of varieties and arranging them into platters for us to take home to enjoy with our families. If I close my eyes, I can taste her famous citrus-glazed shortbread.</p> <p class="""">When I got my first grown-up job in food media after graduation, the annual holiday cookie swap was the pinnacle of the year. It was like the Olympics — the moment everyone had been working towards. Each staffer brought in one cookie to exchange, every single selection more impressive and elaborate than the last. Of course, I ran out of time and used slice and bake, hoping no one would notice. I’m sure they did.</p> <p class="""">You see, holiday cookies are a constant thread that run through the decades. Your dessert table might be full of the same repeat offenders year after year, or you might be the type to try a brand new recipe every year, searching for the holy grail of Christmas cookies. Either way, cookies bring people together to form lasting memories. Here are 63 Christmas cookie recipes to help you form some of your own this holiday season.</p> <p class="""">A hallmark of cookie season, Linzer cookies are the crown jewel of any dessert spread. It’s the cookie dough that sets them apart, which is made with roasted almonds that lend them their signature crumbly texture. Of course, they’d be nothing without the shiny jam-filled windowpane that steals the show.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/cook-smarter/ree-drummond-weeknight-cooking-shortcuts-rcna121910"" target=""_blank"">Ree Drummond</a> gives the classic thumbprint cookie recipe a chocolate-y makeover. In addition to adding cocoa powder to the cookie dough, this version reimagines the standard jam-filling, swapping it for melted chocolate and crushed peppermints.</p> <p class="""">Skip the gingerbread house decorating contest this year and assemble a cookie Christmas tree instead. Start by making the tree-shaped cookie branches, then decorate with buttercream, which acts as the “glue.” Dust with powdered sugar to create a snowy scene with this edible centerpiece.</p> <p class="""">Here’s another winning cookie recipe from The Pioneer Woman herself. These chewy molasses cookies will be the star of your cookie swap. Plus, with just 15 minutes of prep and 10 minutes of baking, you’ll find yourself with plenty of extra time to get your holiday shopping and gift wrapping done.</p> <p class="""">If you’re the kind of person that goes for the corner of the pan every time, this brownie cookie recipe is for you. As it bakes, this brownie-batter style cookie gets crisp around all the edges. Drizzle with melted chocolate, flavored with peppermint extract and dusted with crushed peppermints, it’s the ultimate holiday treat.</p> <p class="""">Whatever you call these treats, there’s no denying that they’re a holiday staple. An Aunt Tillie’s Christmas cookie by any other name is just as sweet! The nostalgic anise-flavored cookies are gently dipped in a simple confectioners’ sugar glaze and topped with rainbow sprinkle balls for a slightly sweet treat that’s perfect for dunking in coffee.</p> <p class="""">Shortbread cookies can be a hit or a miss, but this exacting recipe takes the cake. (I mean cookie.) Delicate and buttery thanks to a combination of cake flour, confectioner’s sugar and butter, these shortbread cookies will melt in your mouth — and your cup of tea, too.</p> <p class="""">Zoë François is the queen of baking, so take her word for it when she tells you to make these maple-raisin holiday cookies. Studded with raisins and glazed with maple-vanilla icing, these whole-wheat Christmas trees are the hearty treat you’ve been searching for.</p> <p class="""">The makings of a <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/best-cookie-recipes-t252879"" target=""_blank"">perfect chocolate chip cookie</a> depend on who you ask. If your personal preference is a balance of chewy and fluffy, give these a try. This recipe calls for both butter and shortening, all-purpose flour and cake flour, light brown sugar and white sugar, to create the ideal formula. It’s a little fussy but once you taste them, you won’t care.</p> <p class="""">Legendary chef <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/lidia-bastianich-eggplant-rollatini-spicy-pork-chops-t294359"" target=""_blank"">Lidia Bastianich</a> has used this traditional cookie recipe to decorate her Christmas tree over the years. Roll out the deep chocolate-y dough and use a cookie cutter to create the stars. To avoid waste, roll the scraps back together to cut as many stars as you can before baking and icing. They’re crisp enough to hang as ornaments and, of course, good enough to eat.</p> <p class="""">Leave it to Ree Drummond to create a cookie recipe with an ingredients list that includes almost everything but the kitchen sink. In this sweet-and-savory cookie, both the doughy base and the iced topping are flecked with white chocolate chips, dried cherries and crushed pretzels.</p> <p class="""">Pro-tip: keep a log of this simple sugar cookie dough in your freezer so you can make them on demand. Then crank up the Christmas music and set up your own cookie-decorating workshop. To frost them like a true baking expert, create two different icings: one that’s a bit thicker to outline the cookie and one that’s thinner to “flood” the cookie.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/donna-kelce-taylor-swift-rcna119059"" target=""_blank"">Donna Kelce</a> has had her fair share of the spotlight this year — and so has her chocolate chip cookie recipe. Made with white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, cinnamon and pecans, there are layers of flavor. These treats are said to be “game-changing” and have the power to bring together even the biggest rivals.</p> <p class="""">Crinkle (or crackle) cookies’ signature powdered sugar surface will have you dreaming of a white Christmas. This version by Jocelyn Delk Adams is flavored with sweet ginger, molasses and lemon for a spiced — yet bright — taste.</p> <p class="""">If you don’t want to bother with baking — don’t! Make these cookies, which are packed with oats and chocolate-hazelnut spread, in just 20 minutes without having to turn on your oven. Just make the egg-free batter then scoop and set on parchment until firm.</p> <p class="""">Christmas cookies come in all shapes and sizes: trees, wreaths, bells, stars, crescents, snowflakes, gingerbread men… and now pinecones! These soft and chewy pinecone-shaped gingerbread cookies are the foundation of a sandwich cookie. Inside, they’re stuffed with chai cream cheese frosting and flavored with a festive combination of vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cloves.</p> <p class="""">Snickerdoodles meet thumbprints in this sweet mashup. The cookie base is rolled in cinnamon-sugar and filled with your favorite jam. Use a mix of whole wheat and all-purpose flour to make this recipe slightly more virtuous.</p> <p class="""">Christina Tosi of Milk Bar fame is the mind behind these Strawberry Shortcake Caramel Snaps, which are topped with freeze-dried strawberry crumbles. The cookie recipe follows her typical formula: “a crunchy cookie base, layered with a flavor center… a crunchy/sandy layer, chocolate coating and a textural topping.” Prep all the components and assemble for a cookie like you’ve never tasted before.</p> <p class="""">According to TODAY Food contributor Alejandra Ramos, “it seems like just about every country has their own version of this sweet treat.” You may have heard them called Mexican Wedding Cookies or Russian Tea Cakes, but this variety is called polvorones, after the Spanish word “polvo” which means dust. It, of course, refers to the powdered sugar that coats each cookie ball like a light snowfall.</p> <p class="""">Everyone’s favorite cookie just got a makeover. Instead of using regular butter, take some extra time to <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/natasha-pickowicz-more-cake-cookbook-recipes-t289901"" target=""_blank"">brown it</a> on the stovetop before cooling to room temperature and adding it to the batter. The nutty, rich flavor adds a whole new dimension to chocolate chip cookies. Top with flaky sea salt to bring out the flavors even more.</p> <p class="""">This cookie recipe has everything you love about a brownie: three types of chocolate, a fudgy center, crinkly top and a chewy bite. Portion the batter out using cookie scoops, then bake right away for perfectly glossy tops. You can also prep this dough ahead of time and store it in the freezer to bake off whenever that chocolate craving strikes.</p> <p class="""">A departure from Tosi’s typical dessert recipes, this cut-out cookie recipe only requires 4 ingredients: butter, light brown sugar, all-purpose flour and salt. There’s nostalgia in the simplicity of this pantry cookie. Cream the butter and sugar, then add the flour and salt before refrigerating. Roll out, cut into shapes with your favorite cookie cutters, then bake and decorate.</p> <p class="""">A trip to England inspired this Hobnob recipe — also in Tosi’s cookbook, All About Cookies. The base of this cookie uses oats for a granola bar-style texture. Covered with chocolate and coated with toffee bits, these cookies are just begging for you to bake them.</p> <p class="""">Leave it to Martha Stewart to elevate classic shortbread into a work of art that’s fit for the holidays. These wreath-shaped rounds are infused with both Meyer lemon juice and zest. The simple royal icing glaze is infused with thyme and rosemary, which give these cookies another layer of sophistication.</p> <p class="""">According to Christina Tosi, these cookies pay homage to the Take 5 candy bar. The flavor combo is simple: sugar, peanut butter, honey, chocolate and caramel. It’s salty, sweet, nutty and will give you everything you love about the Halloween treat in the form of a Christmas cookie.</p> <p class="""">Like most great inventions, this cookie discovery was an accident. Christina Tosi realized that using leftover fryer oil from cannoli and funnel cakes would make this cookie taste just like a jelly doughnut. See for yourself and try making these sandwich cookies.</p> <p class="""">These classic thumbprints are all the best parts of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The cookie base is rolled in chopped peanuts for a salty crunchy texture. Once baked, use a spoon to dent the center of each cookie before adding a scoop of preserves, then bake once more until set.</p> <p class="""">It wouldn’t be a Christina Tosi recipe without cornflakes! This recipe for cornflake-marshmallow cookies with crushed candy canes was adapted from Tosi’s first cookbook. First make the crunch with cereal, milk powder, sugar, salt and butter, then cool before adding it into the cookie batter. These cookies will puff, crackle, then spread for premium ingredient distribution throughout.</p> <p class="""">If you have a box of store-bought brownie mix in your pantry and some leftover coffee from your pot of morning Joe, you’re just a few steps away from these fudge candy cane cookies. Combine the brownie mix with flour, baking soda, salt, butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla and coffee. Throw in some chocolate chips and crushed candy canes for a taste of holiday in every bite. The best part? They only bake for eight minutes.</p> <p class="""">Old-fashioned peanut butter cookies are a staple in holiday cookie tins across the country. This version doesn’t reinvent the wheel — it perfects it. Peanut butter balls are rolled in granulated sugar, then pressed with the tines of a fork to create a classic criss-cross pattern. You can also use this dough recipe as the base for peanut blossoms by pressing a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie once baked.</p> <p class="""">Turn a tube of store-bought cookie dough into a feast for your eyes — and stomach. Simply preheat your oven, then roll the cookie dough into balls and dunk in a bowl of assorted sprinkles until completely covered. Place on a cookie sheet, gently flatten and bake.</p> <p class="""">Martha Stewart’s version of Russian tea cakes go by the name “Noël nut balls.” The buttery, nutty dough — studded with finely chopped pecans — is flavored with bourbon or orange juice for added flavor. Don’t skimp on the powdered sugar coating, either — a layer melts into the cookie and is everyone’s favorite part.</p> <p class="""">Why make two dozen cookies when you can make just one giant one? This funfetti cookie cake is loaded with rainbow sprinkles and frosted with vanilla buttercream. There’s just something delightful about cutting this giant cookie into slices, which is meant for sharing.</p> <p class="""">Excerpted from Ina Garten’s The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, this shortbread cookie recipe is inspired by NYC establishment Zabar’s. She gives the shortbread a festive twist with pecans, which she roasts first for added flavor. (A great tip to remember when baking with any type of nut!).</p> <p class="""">This simple-yet-elevated sugar cookie base — flavored with vanilla bean paste and sour cream — is chilled and rolled in festive sanding sugar before baking. The end result is cookies that are crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.</p> <p class="""">You’d never guess that this gorgeous, fancy-sounding Palmier recipe only requires two ingredients: store-bought puff pastry and granulated sugar. If that’s not enough of a challenge, you can attempt to make homemade puff pastry. But the shortcut method will reveal light, airy, golden brown and caramelized palmiers every time.</p> <p class="""">The beauty of crinkle cookies is that they’re endlessly customizable. This version is for those family members who don’t eat dessert unless it has chocolate in it. To bring out the chocolate flavor even more, the ingredients list calls for a teaspoon of instant espresso powder and fleur de sel for sprinkling on top of the cookies once they come out of the oven.</p> <p class="""">While delightful and tasty, these sugar cookies are best for keeping kids busy at your next holiday family gathering. Bake off the sugar cookie shapes and make royal icing in an assortment of different colors. Set up an assembly line of sprinkles and edible decorations and prepare for a feast for the eyes.</p> <p class="""">These gluten and dairy-free snickerdoodles taste just like your grandma used to make them. (Seriously!) Sweetened with maple sugar, this cashew and coconut flour base is coated with cinnamon sugar and baked until soft and chewy.</p> <p class="""">One bite into these powdered sugar-dusted snowball cookies will reveal a red velvet center. Add just a few drops of red food coloring to the cocoa batter, then roll into balls and bake before coating in melted butter and powdered sugar. Cue Lou Lou Who’s, “now that’s holiday!”</p> <p class="""">Most Christmas cookies aren’t known for being ‘light,” but this coconut macaroon fits the bill. These pillowy macaroons are soft and chewy and loaded with shredded coconut flakes. You can even kick these up a notch by drizzling the cooled cookies with melted chocolate. Bonus: this recipe is <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/what-gluten-free-diet-here-s-everything-you-need-know-t202154"" target=""_blank"">gluten-free</a>.</p> <p class="""">Oatmeal raisin cookies have a bad rap. Not only are raisins one of the most maligned types of dried fruit out there, but they're also easily mistaken for chocolate chips which (most would argue) are the superior cookie add-in. But for those who have a soft spot for oatmeal raisin, this recipe is worthwhile. The oats are toasted to bring out more flavor, while cardamom makes them feel “grown up” and molasses keeps them tender and chewy.</p> <p class="""">The best holiday mornings start with a biscotti and a cup of tea. Plus, green pistachios and dried red cherries add a festive look to this classic tea dunker. Enjoy one of these with white chocolate drizzle to get you through the whirlwind that is December 24th to January 1.</p> <p class="""">If you’ve graduated from the two-ingredient shortcut version, here’s the long way to make palmiers. Hint: It involves making homemade puff pastry. But don’t worry, you can do it! Once you’ve nailed it, these delicate swirly, twirly French cookies are beautiful enough to put on display! Wrap them in cellophane so everyone can see the fruits of your labor.</p> <p class="""">Once you learn how to make Linzer cookies, you’ll never buy them from a bakery again. Don’t have a powdered sugar shaker? Use a cheesecloth filled with confectioners’ sugar, tie with kitchen twine and sprinkle a layer of snow over your holiday treats.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/food/tasty-matcha-green-tea-drink-recipes-t19501"" target=""_blank"">Matcha</a> is the perfect match for buttery shortbread. Adding just a few tablespoons of matcha powder to your standard shortbread dough will give it a green holiday glow. Cut the cookies into stars or trees, and decorate with dipped chocolate and sanding sugar.</p> <p class="""">The only thing missing from these peppermint-hot cocoa cookies is a glass of hot cocoa to dunk them in! Bake the chocolatey cookies first, then top with a halved marshmallow. Once the marshmallow is melted, drizzle with chocolate and top with crushed candy canes for an ooey, gooey, textural delight.</p> <p class="""">This Linzer cookie recipe swaps almonds for walnuts as the base of the crumbly dough. As if that switch up wasn’t revolutionary enough, it calls for filling with Biscoff spread instead of jam, for a warm, buttery take on the typical puckery raspberry filling.</p> <p class="""">Brownies meet s’mores in this chewy cookie recipe. The dough base gets a deep color and flavor from a half cup of cocoa powder. Scoop it out on a baking sheet and place a marshmallow in the center of each cookie. After baking for 8 to 10 minutes, the cookie will have spread and the marshmallow will be golden brown. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, crushed peppermint candy, toffee bits, chocolate chips or whatever your heart desires.</p> <p class="""">For those unfamiliar, mandelbrot is a German-style biscotti that’s a bit easier to make than the Italian version. The dough is flecked with walnuts and shaped into logs. Sprinkle with sanding sugar (one red, one green of course), then slice and bake until the edges are golden brown. Just like biscotti, it’s the perfect dipping cookie.</p> <p class="""">You can make chocolate chip cookies all year long, but white chocolate peppermint cookies have a certain window in which they’re best enjoyed — and that’s cookie swap season. Make a simple dough with white and brown sugar, shortening, butter, eggs, vanilla, peppermint and flour, then stir in a healthy amount of white chocolate chips and soft peppermint.</p> <p class="""">There’s a reason people buy rainbow cookies from Italian bakeries rather than making them at home. While they require a bit of TLC, the payout is worth the effort. Make layers of delicate almond sponge cake (in festive colors) and layer with raspberry jam, apricot jam and chocolate glaze. Stick with classic green and red or let your little ones go crazy with every color of the rainbow.</p> <p class="""">When they first came out, these chocolate chunk shortbread cookies by Alison Roman went so viral that they became known as “The Cookies.” Made with salted butter, light brown sugar, chocolate chunks and flour, this dough sets in the freezer until you’re ready to slice and bake. Don’t skimp on the Demerara sugar coating — it’s what gives these cookies their sparkly, crispy edges.</p> <p class="""">Leave it to Martha to develop a cookie recipe that’s almost too pretty to eat. Almost. These string-light Christmas tree cookies are trimmed with white chocolate garlands and red candy ornaments. Of course, we can’t forget the cookie star on top.</p> <p class="""">Snickerdoodles are Savannah Guthrie’s favorite holiday cookie. This recipe puts a twist on the classic. Instead of rolling them in cinnamon sugar, bake the cinnamon spice right into the dough. Roll in sanding sugar instead for a pop of color.</p> <p class="""">Sweet butterscotch chips, white chocolate chips and chopped pecans are the stars of this holiday cookie recipe. As with most great cookie recipes, these taste best when slightly underbaked. Do with that information what you will.</p> <p class="""">Elevate the classic chocolate chip cookie with one festive addition: candied hazelnuts. In a large skillet, cook hazelnuts, sugar and water until the sugar dissolves and thickens around the hazelnuts. Once they’re golden brown in color, remove from the heat, season with salt, then cool before adding to the cookie dough. They’ll be a sweet surprise in every bite.</p> <p class="""">Let this savory macaron recipe be your cookie swap wildcard. The shells are pretty standard: almond flour, powdered sugar, egg whites, sugar and water, but it’s the filling that really sets these apart. Made with cream, duck fat, rosemary, sage, thyme and white chocolate, it’s a little out of left field. According to the recipe developer, “they taste like the last bite of your Thanksgiving meal.” All we can say is don’t knock it ‘til you try it.</p> <p class="""">Here’s a gluten-free option for your dessert table that isn’t at all run of the mill. This corn and sorghum chocolate cookie is so tender it has the texture of a brownie. Dip them in chocolate and sprinkles for even more festive flair.</p> <p class="""">Straight out of your holiday Pinterest board, these delightful Santa hat meringues will be the one treat everyone wants to take a photo of. Once the hats are piped, baked and cooled, dip in melted white chocolate and coat the fur trim and cotton ball tip in white coconut.</p> <p class="""">It’s not very often that a dessert is “refreshing,” but this lemon cookie with white chocolate chips fits the bill. These citrus holiday cookies transform a traditional sugar cookie into a tart and subtly sweet treat that’ll cleanse your palate after a hearty dinner — so you’re ready for even more cookies.</p> <p class="""">Potato chips make everything better: dips, sandwiches and, yes, even cookies. For this recipe, be sure to spring for kettle cooked chips, which will retain some of their crunchiness after baking. The chips serve the same purpose as flaky sea salt, but add a fun textural surprise that’ll get everyone talking.</p> <p class="""">Prepare to be mesmerized by these swirly clouds of meringue. For the perfect swirl, use chopsticks to gently incorporate the raspberry coulis into the meringue. The tart berry balances out the sweetness of the meringue, making this the perfect dessert for the “not-too-sweet” set.</p> <p class=""endmark"">This recipe is a twist on the iconic original from a decades-old Betty Crocker cookbook, tweaked by the winner of the TODAY holiday cookie contest. While these cookies may look like peppermint sticks, they’re flavored with almond and vanilla extract. Be sure to dip in powdered sugar while still warm for a dusting of snow.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Lauren Masur is a food and lifestyle writer.

She notes that people have even confessed to her, “I had a kid because I wanted them to be famous.” </p> <p class="""">Sweetin says she is grateful that was not her experience.<a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/parents/jodie-sweetin-explains-adoptive-parents-connection-biological-family-rcna24984"" target=""_blank""> Her parents, Sam and Janice</a>, never had a desire to see their faces on billboards. </p> <p class="""">Of course, many factors can cause a celebrity to spiral, and even wonderful parents can't inocculate a child against addiction. Sweetin has been open about her own struggles with addiction. She started drinking at 14 after ""Full House"" went off the air, and would later battle an addiction to crystal meth, among other drugs. </p> <p class="""">""It was a huge shift in my life. Everything I had known from the time I was 5 years old suddenly ended and it was like saying goodbye to a family I had loved very, very much,” Sweetin said during an episode of<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DECyQ_GRFPo"" target=""_blank""> ""Dancing With the Stars"" </a>in 2016. “At such a young age it really was a huge loss for me, I didn’t know how to grieve. Drugs and alcohol just sort of numbed everything.”</p> <p class="""">Sweetin has been sober since 2011, and is even a certified drug and alcohol counselor. Now, she's got her life together and is a loving mom of two.</p> <p class="""">According to Sweetin, child actors need a strong support system now more than ever. She’s says social media has made things “a lot rougher” than they were when she was growing up. </p> <p class="""">“I can’t imagine being one of those kids on a big network show that gets all of the attention and all of the criticism. And people are worrying about who you’re dating, and what you look like,” Sweetin shares. </p> <p class="""">“When I was nine, I had teeth coming out of every direction,” she continues. “I was very self-conscious of it at the time, and if that had been the thing that was getting made fun of online? That would have destroyed me.”</p> <p class="""">Dealing with the tabloids was hard enough, Sweetin says. She’s still haunted by a story that was published about herself and her beloved co-star <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/bob-saget-beloved-comedian-full-house-star-dies-65-rcna11552"" target=""_blank"">Bob Saget, who passed away in 2022</a>.  </p> <p class="""">“It said I was difficult child to work with and that Bob Saget was trying to get me fired. And I remember just being so confused because it was so far from the truth. I spent time with Bob and his family on the weekends,” she says. “Now (with social media) it’s not only more instantaneous, but it’s everywhere and omnipresent in every single corner of your life.”</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/jodie-sweetin-daughters-full-house-not-impressed-fans-rcna83797"" target=""_blank"">Sweetin’s daughters Zoie, 15, and Beatrix, 12,</a> understand that that their mom will not tolerate any online bullying.</p> <p class="""">“My one real, real, real, hard line is you do not make yourself feel better at the expense of someone else. You don’t know what that person is going though. You don’t know what their life is like at home,” Sweetin says. “Anytime there’s been online chatter amongst their friends, if I find any hint of bullying, I’m like, ‘Nope, your phone is gone. That’s it.”</p> <p class="""">Sweetin opened up to TODAY.com while promoting her partnership with Align Probiotic. The brand recently launched Bloating Relief + Food Digestion capsules to relieve digestive upsets.</p> <p class="""">Sweetin says she no longer feels “gross” and “bloated” after indulging in heavy on-set catering, and has been recommending the capsules to all of her friends.</p> <p class=""endmark"">“They were like, ‘Seriously?’ And I’m like, ‘It really, really works,” Sweetin says. “As much as we try to wear our stretchy eating pants this time of year, sometimes you got to dress up and you got to look cute, and you don’t want that ... bloated, gross gassy feeling to ruin your holiday plans.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Rachel Paula Abrahamson is a lifestyle reporter who writes for the parenting, health and shop verticals.

In most of the photos, she's wearing baggy jeans, but one image in particular stood out to her followers.</p> <p class="""">In the photo, EmRata, as she's affectionately known, stands in a pair of light-wash jeans several (if not more) sizes too large for her. She also extends the jeans' waist band, highlighting the space in the pants that she doesn't fill. The second image in the Instagram carousel is the only one featuring her wearing this particular pair.</p> <p class="""">Instagram users were quick to question the sartorial choice in the comments on Ratajkowski's post.</p> <p class="""">“What in the fatphobic hell is that second picture?” one person wrote, adding the clown emoji.</p> <p class="""">""Fatphobic vibes?"" someone else asked.</p> <p class="""">""Not sure how u think wearing oversized jeans made for a much larger person and accentuating your smallness promotes healthy body image like you preach in your books/social media. shame on you,"" another person wrote.</p> <p class="""">""What’s the point of the big pants? To show up how skinny you are?"" another person commented.</p> <p class="""">Ratajkowski's team declined TODAY.com's request for comment.</p> <p class="""">Gianluca Russo, author of ""The Power of Plus"" and expert on the size-inclusive fashion movement, tells TODAY.com via email that he normally takes backlash ""with a grain of salt"" — but in this case, he does believe ""the comments around this photo are warranted, as is a larger conversation.""</p> <p class="""">""This photo could likely be very triggering to someone dealing with the terrible impacts of weight stigma as it so clearly mimics triggering weight loss ads,"" he says. ""The photo of Emily is praising her thinness, and the usage of a very large pair of pants puts even more emphasis on the smallness of her body.""</p> <p class="""">Some Instagram users saw the photo as an opportunity to call out how difficult it can be to find fashionable clothing for bigger bodies.</p> <p class="""">Plus-size model <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/health/tess-holliday-responds-body-shamer-grossed-big-fat-ppl-rcna33037"" target=""_blank"">Tess Holliday</a> joked: ""I’ve been looking for those jeans in the second photo if you could just please return them that would cool. Tysm.""</p> <p class="""">Another person added: “Designers won’t make plus sizes unless it’s for a photo opp where a thin person can be quirky.”</p> <p class="""">Another criticism of the photo was tied to Ratajkowski's <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/books/emily-ratajkowski-my-body-book-men-readers-rcna48102?search=emily%20ratajkowski%20book"" target=""_blank"">2021 book ""My Body,”</a> a collection of essays about feminism, sexuality and taking ownership over her body.</p> <p class="""">""Writing a book called 'my body', a book about body empowerment and loving yourself and then posing for the second pic is crazy,"" one commenter pointed out.</p> <p class="""">""That second picture…..do you need to read your own book? Like? It’s so tasteless,"" someone else commented.</p> <p class="""">Russo also says he thinks the photo shoot was a missed opportunity.</p> <p class="""">""This could have been an editorial that discussed the importance of plus-sizes — especially given Emily’s book on body image — but rather, it furthered a fatphobic image type that we’ve become all too familiar with,"" he explains.</p> <p class="""">M Magazine also faced backlash for the artistic choices behind the photo shoot. The magazine did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment.</p> <p class="""">""Please explain how having a model hold up a pair of pants that are too large for her to wear in the extreme is fashion. Oversized clothes are one thing but this photo with the jeans that are too big is something else. Tell us the vision. What is the story you’re trying to tell?"" one person asked.</p> <p class="""">""This is extremely insensitive, untasteful, and wrong on so many levels. No one thinks this is a good idea. How did this get past PR teams?!?!?"" another person wrote.</p> <p class="""">""Fire the art director. Fatphobia doesn’t look good on you,"" someone else commented.</p> <p class="""">Russo agrees that the photo shows that ""people in fashion — both in front and behind the camera — are still uneducated (about) size-inclusivity.""</p> <p class=""endmark"">""Even further, it shows that many of them do not care about the importance here,"" he adds.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Dea is an editorial intern at TODAY.com and is frequently keeping up with pop culture news and emerging trends.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Let's just say some — actually, many — of the scenes aren't fit for workplace conversation.</p> <p class="""">“Saltburn” was written and directed by Emerald Fennell, who received an Oscar for her directorial debut “Promising Young Woman,” and explores themes of power, envy, desire and relationships.  </p> <p class="""">The sensual, thrilling movie opens on a cross-class meet cute: Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) arrives at Oxford University and almost instantly becoming fixated on wealthy student Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). After learning of Oliver's difficult upbringing, Felix invites him to spend the summer at his family estate, Saltburn.</p> <p class="""">Throughout their summer at Saltburn, Oliver’s interactions with Felix’s family and the estate itself grow in intensity, evoking excitement, discomfort and disgust. </p> <p class="""">By the end of the movie, for better or worse, viewers will almost certainly experience a moment of, “What did I just watch?” To help you process the movie, we are breaking down some of the most, uh, unforgettable scenes and what Fennell had to say about them.  </p> <p class="""">Fennell calls this scene the ""sexiest thing (she's) ever seen in (her) life,"" per an interview with <a href=""https://people.com/jacob-elordi-barry-keoghan-saltburn-bathtub-scene-is-sexy-exclusive-8405875"" target=""_blank"">People.</a> As for where you come down on it? Well ... check out the details and decide.</p> <p class="""">Oliver and Felix are sharing a bathroom at Saltburn. One night, Oliver watches Felix masturbate in the bathtub, without Felix noticing. When Felix leaves the bathroom, Oliver heads over to the bathtub. As the water is going down the drain, he licks the tub, eventually getting to the drain in a fit of passion (or desperation).</p> <p class="""">(Elordi told <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/film/columns/saltburn-jacob-elordi-barry-keoghan-1235792109/"" target=""_blank"">Variety</a> he was ""very proud"" to ""have Barry Keoghan guzzling it like that.”) </p> <p class="""">In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theringer.com/movies/2023/11/22/23971515/saltburn-movie-emerald-fennell-barry-keoghan-bathtub-grave-scene"" target=""_blank"">The Ringer</a>, Keoghan unpacked his character's motivations in that moment.</p> <p class="""">“The moment where he rubs his face along the plughole and wants to be in it, it’s sort of like, ‘I want to feel it, I want it to be part of me, I want it to change me,’” Keoghan said. “It’s a total obsession. He’s confused and lost. I don’t think he knows what he’s actually chasing.” </p> <p class="""">Fennell, on her end, thinks it's ""unbelievably sexy,"" as she told <a href=""https://time.com/6338652/saltburn-ending-emerald-fennell/"" target=""_blank"">Time</a>.</p> <p class="""">""To me the bathtub is just an incredibly erotic scene,” Fennell said. “It is all the things that something stirring should be, which is funny and intimate and shocking and revolting and unbelievably sexy. What I was trying to make with this film was something that felt actually true about the nature of desire. For desire to really take you in its grip like it does in this movie, it has to be to a certain degree transgressive. It has to be something you wouldn’t necessarily want people to see.”  </p> <p class="""">Like the <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/fair-play-ending-explained-rcna120873"" target=""_blank"">recent movie ""Fair Play</a>,"" ""Saltburn"" features women having sex while menstruating. Both scenes are sensual and aim to confront a topic Fennell says people are ""squeamish about.""</p> <p class="""">Oliver develops a connection with Felix's troubled sister Venetia (Alison Oliver). He knows, through Venetia's mother Elspeth (Rosamund Pike), that she struggles with disordered eating. </p> <p class="""">“That’s the information that he takes into the next scene, telling Venetia that her body, rather than something disgusting, is in fact beautiful and arousing,” Fennell told Time. </p> <p class="""">Oliver uses a moment alone with her to reference her insecurities with food and her body, but with assertiveness and softness, leading to a flirtatious interaction. It's up to interpretation whether he brought up her insecurities to flatter her or to exert power over her — possibly both.  </p> <p class="""">The mood between them becomes sexually charged. Although Venetia tells Oliver it's not ""right time of the month"" for them to be intimate, he proceeds anyway. Oliver eventually spreads blood on both of their faces.  </p> <p class="""">""It’s an incredibly effective sex scene because he’s worshiping her body, and everything that her body produces, and that’s not something that anyone has ever done for her before,” Fennell told Time.   </p> <p class="""">Felix and Oliver's friendship crashes and burns. The night after their falling out, Felix dies. But since Felix’s family is not aware of their fight, they treat Oliver like family through the funeral.</p> <p class="""">After everyone leaves the cemetery, Oliver stays behind. Under the rain, Oliver cries over Felix’s fresh grave. </p> <p class="""">If, based on what you've read so far, you suspect that Oliver is about to get carried away, you're right. The scene develops slowly. Oliver, facing down on the dirt, starts to move his body, lower his pants and ... penetrate the soil.</p> <p class="""">What's <em>that</em> all about? </p> <p class="""">“It’s about grief. It’s about love,” Fennell said to <a href=""https://time.com/6338652/saltburn-ending-emerald-fennell/"" target=""_blank"">Time</a>. “It’s an attempt to get some form of impossible closure. And the reason that scene is so long is because we needed the whole emotional journey. It’s an attempt at something that is totally futile; Oliver himself understands how absurd and appalling and ridiculous is the position he’s in.”  </p> <p class="""">Years go by and the rest of the Catton family dies. Somehow, Oliver ends up inheriting the Saltburn estate, and he enjoys it. He can do anything he wants now — including dance around naked, which he does, to the song ""Murder on the Dance Floor by Sophie Ellis-Bextor.</p> <p class="""">The dance number wraps up the very stylish and vibrant movie with precise Oliver vibes: slightly unhinged, disturbingly attractive and confusingly enjoyable.  </p> <p class="""">Fennell said the ending was supposed to make viewers consider whether they were ""on Oliver's side"" — and, according to her, they should be.</p> <p class="""">“A walkthrough didn’t have that post-coital triumph. If we all did our job correctly, you are on Oliver’s side,” Fennell told <a href=""https://ew.com/saltburn-ending-barry-keoghan-emerald-fennell-naked-dance-8403813"" target=""_blank"">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “You don’t care what he does, you want him to do it. You are both completely repulsed and sort of on his side. It’s that kind of dance with the devil. It’s like, ‘F---. Okay, let’s go.’ And so at the end, it needed to have a triumph, a post-coital win, a desecration.”  </p> <p class=""endmark""> </p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

She also asked for a ""cool"" mouthwash dispenser, a stone bath mat, a hands-free TikTok scroller and an automatic trash can. </p> <p class="""">“You want a $200 Target gift card?” exclaimed Victoria during the presentation. “Wow!” </p> <p class="""">Renea’s viewers said Makayla's list was ""organized and practical,"" highlighting her ""leadership skills.""

What would it look like if the survival thriller became a real life competition show?</p> <p class="""">The <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/netflix-announced-squid-game-competition-series-fans-say-goes-original-rcna33800"" target=""_blank"">reality adaptation was critiqued</a> when it was first announced for seeming to miss the point of the fictional show, which is a criticism of capitalism and the system of inequality that would push people to participate in such a deadly game.</p> <p class="""">The Korean series centers on a mysterious game 456 people willingly participate in for the chance to win 45.6 billion Won (about $35 million). But most participants don’t know the stakes of the game when they enter: Only one will win the jackpot, and all others will be killed at some point during heightened versions of children’s games. </p> <p class="""">The reality series also has 456 players competing in similar games for a jackpot of the same amount, but without the lethal consequences.</p> <p class="""">""Squid Game"" creator Hwang Dong-hyuk spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the series, saying he had met with the creator. ""What I hope is that they will be carrying on my vision and intention as much as possible for the show,"" he said, and added that viewers concerned by the premise should not ""take things too seriously, that's really not the best way to go for the entertainment industry.""</p> <p class="""">More controversy emerged in practice. About a week into filming, the show made headlines as eliminated contestants spoke out about their experience. </p> <p class="""">Back in February, contestants opened up to outlets like <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stone</a> and Variety on the conditions their names would not be used, alleging poor set conditions and rigging behind the scenes. Following the release of the first five episodes from Season One, some players are now threatening to sue for the alleged injuries they suffered on set. </p> <p class="""">Other contestants — like those who <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/squid-game-the-challenge-contestants-speak-out-rcna126308"" target=""_blank"">spoke to TODAY.com about their time on the show</a> — confirmed the environment was “stressful.” But, they said the conditions were “fair” and expected considering 456 players were competing for $4.56 million dollars, the biggest cash prize in reality television history. </p> <p class="""">Here is a rundown of what “Squid Game: The Challenge”’s eliminated players have revealed about their experience on the controversial series.</p> <p class="""">“Squid Game: The Challenge” was first announced in <a href=""https://deadline.com/2022/06/squid-game-reality-series-netflix-1235045051/"" target=""_blank"">June 2022</a>, with multiple publications confirming that the show would be filmed in the United Kingdom. </p> <p class="""">Filming began in January 2023 and “Squid Game: The Challenge” almost immediately became embroiled in controversy. At the time, parts of the UK were affected by a cold snap, which brought ice, snow and extremely low temperatures to the region. The Sun was the first to publish multiple articles claiming that contestants battled cold weather during the first game of Red Light, Green Light. </p> <p class="""">During Red Light, Green Light, all 456 contestants have five minutes to cross the finish line. They are only able to move when a giant robot doll is singing. When she stops singing, they have to pause. If they move, they are eliminated.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://variety.com/2023/tv/global/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-frozen-inhumane-welfare-1235511809/"" target=""_blank"">Variety also reported</a> on the alleged injuries some players suffered during the first round. Even though they received hand warmers and thermal underwear, the outlet said that a small number of contestants needed medical care after playing the game, which took place in a former airplane hangar. </p> <p class="""">Netflix responded to the medical treatment claims in a statement to Variety at the time. “We care deeply about the health and safety of our cast and crew, and invested in all the appropriate safety procedures. While it was very cold on set — and participants were prepared for that — any claims of serious injury are untrue,” the company said. </p> <p class="""">In a statement sent to the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-64403653"" target=""_blank"">BBC</a>, Netflix confirmed that three people received treatment for “mild medical conditions.” </p> <p class="""">About a week later, <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stone</a> published an article after speaking with four contestants who alleged they suffered the “cruelest” conditions on the show. </p> <p class="""">“It was just the cruelest, meanest thing I’ve ever been through,” one anonymous eliminated player told the magazine. “We were a human horse race, and they were treating us like horses out in the cold racing and (the race) was fixed.”</p> <p class="""">The players, who asked the magazine their names were not included due to their non-disclosure agreements, said the Red Light, Green Light game lasted about nine hours and that medics tended to contestants who couldn’t handle the freezing temperatures in the airport hangar. </p> <p class="""">One alleged they saw a woman convulsing. “People were beating themselves up, including myself, around the fact that you’ve got a girl convulsing and we’re all stood there like statues,” the player said. “On what planet is that even humane? Obviously, you would jump and help — that’s what our human nature is for most of us. But absolutely it’s a social experiment. It played on our morals and it’s sick. It’s absolutely sick.” </p> <p class="""">Another claimed, “My legs went completely numb.” One eliminated player told the magazine she had pneumonia and an ear infection after competing. </p> <p class="""">A day after the Rolling Stone report, <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/tv/global/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-frozen-inhumane-welfare-1235511809/"" target=""_blank"">Variety</a> published another article with details from eliminated contestants. One person said, “It’s not like we signed up for ‘Survivor’ or ‘Naked and Afraid.’</p> <p class="""">Another told Variety that bathroom and water breaks were not allowed while Red Light, Green Light was being filmed. “I’ve never been that cold for that long a period in my life. We couldn’t feel our feet or our toes. It was ridiculous,” she said. </p> <p class="""">Netflix and The Garden and Studio Lambert, two production companies behind the series, told Rolling Stone and Variety in identical statements at the time that they took “all the appropriate safety precautions, including after care for contestants — and an independent adjudicator is overseeing each game to ensure it’s fair to everyone.” </p> <p class="""">The streaming giant also pushed back against reports of the games being rigged. “Any suggestion that the competition is rigged or claims of serious harm to players are simply untrue,” Netflix said in statements to Variety and Rolling Stone. </p> <p class="""">Players who spoke to Rolling Stone said that some contestants were miked up and others were given fake microphones because storylines were predetermined for players with larger social media followings. </p> <p class="""">One said they saw an eliminated player rejoin the game. “It really wasn’t a game show,” the eliminated contestant said. “It was a TV show, and we were basically extras in a TV show.”</p> <p class="""">Three players said there was a “38-second massacre” in round one when contestants who thought they made it across the finish line within the five-minute time limit were eliminated. </p> <p class="""">One said she saw a contestant, who went on the show with his mom, was crying as he waited for her to cross the finish line. </p> <p class="""">“They added (more time) to the clock for her to get across because she was one of the people that they wanted to be in the show,” the person said.</p> <p class="""">Another told Rolling Stone, “Instead of 'Squid Game', (they) are calling it ‘Rigged Game.’ Instead of Netflix, they’re calling it ‘Net Fix,’ because it was clearly obvious.” </p> <p class="""">TODAY.com has reached out to Netflix for comment.</p> <p class="""">On Nov. 23, one day after the series premiered, a British personal injury firm called Express Solicitors posted on its <a href=""https://www.expresssolicitors.co.uk/blog/express-solicitors-in-the-news#news1"" target=""_blank"">website</a> that two “Squid Game: The Challenge” contestants reached out to Daniel Slade, the firm's chief executive officer (legal), about a potential lawsuit. </p> <p class="""">The firm said the contestants sought “compensation for injuries they suffered during the show’s filming in January of this year.” </p> <p class="""">Express Solicitors confirmed in a statement to TODAY.com that the firm is looking into the allegations. </p> <p class="""">“No lawsuit has been filed yet, but we have served letters of claim to the show’s producers for two contestants outlining their injury claims and now we are gathering further evidence before filing court action if necessary,” Express Solicitors said. </p> <p class="""">The contestants are alleging that they suffered hypothermia and nerve damage, the firm said. One said the clothing was “ill-fitting” given the cold temperatures. </p> <p class="""">TODAY.com previously reached out to Netflix and Studio Lambert about the potential for legal claims but did not hear back. A spokesperson for the reality show sent a statement to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2023/11/squid-game-the-challenge-contestants-threaten-injury-lawsuit-1235635675/"" target=""_blank"">Deadline</a> that said, “No lawsuit has been filed by any of the ‘Squid Game’ contestants. We take the welfare of our contestants extremely seriously.”</p> <p class="""">TODAY.com interviewed former players Lorenzo (Player 161), Dani (Player 134), Spencer (Player 299) and Bryton (Player 432), who were all eliminated in the show’s first five episodes. They spoke about preparing for the competitions and the elimination process. </p> <p class="""">Lorenzo said he took multiple ice baths and cold showers. He also said the dorm was “livable.”</p> <p class="""">“Let’s put it (this) way. You can survive in those conditions. And, if you don’t adapt, you don’t deserve to be there,” he shared. </p> <p class="""">Spencer, who was shown worrying and repeatedly gagging during round two as he struggled during the Dalgona challenge, said that the contestants would wait hours for the competitions to begin. To prepare, he said he accumulated spit in his mouth for hours. </p> <p class="""">In the fictional series, contestants had to carve out a shape from the honeycomb sugar candy. Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) realized the candy melted when it encountered liquid, and<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJxTysByZ8"" target=""_blank""> licked the umbrella shape</a> to make it easier to remove. </p> <p class="""">“I know many people in that room were focused on saving up as much spit in their mouth as they could and I, myself, was saving up spit for the past few hours because I had no idea over the past few hours when the game would finally begin,” Spencer said. </p> <p class="""">He called the environment “stressful” but he also seemed to have an enjoyable time on the show. Player 299 said the experience was like “adult summer camp.”</p> <p class="""">In Bryton’s opinion, “Squid Game: The Challenge” and the eliminations were fair. </p> <p class=""endmark"">“You knew what you were signing up for before you even got there. Yeah, some things take skill, but it also comes down to luck,” he said. “So everything is fair. There’s nothing that was unfair in there.” </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Ariana Brockington is a trending news reporter at TODAY digital.

Cyber Monday falls on the Monday after Black Friday every year. </p> <p>Cyber Monday, like Black Friday, is a shopping holiday that takes place the Monday after Thanksgiving and is known as the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season. </p> <p>This year, like Cyber Mondays in the past, you can expect <a href=""http://www.today.com/cybermonday"" target=""_blank"">major markdowns</a> at big retailers like Amazon, Target, Nordstrom, Wayfair and so much more. Shop TODAY previously spoke to experts to see how you can score the best deals and get the most out of the holiday shopping event. </p> <p>There are a few ways to ensure you’re getting the best deals. <a href=""https://www.retailmenot.com/"" target=""_blank"">RetailMeNot</a> Shopping Expert, Kristin McGrath previously told Shop TODAY in an interview that the best way to get ahead of the game is to have plan and snag your desired items as soon as it goes on sale. Which means now is a good time to hop on those early deals that are going on right now. </p> <p>Another way to check if you’re getting the best price is by downloading our <a href=""https://www.today.com/shop/shop-today-savings-coupons"" target=""_blank"">Shop TODAY Savings coupon extension</a> to your Google Chrome. It automatically finds and applies the highest discounts so you can save the most money without trying! </p> <p>If you’re looking to get the biggest bang for your buck, Julie Ramhold, Consumer Analyst with <a href=""http://dealnews.com/"" target=""_blank"">DealNews.com</a> suggests to shop around because many retailers will have the same product at different prices. </p> <p>“So many different stores will have so many sales competing that there’s a good chance you can find a lower price on something that you want. Be sure to look at retailers you might not ordinarily shop at to see if they have better deals than your tried-and-true stores,” Ramhold previously told Shop TODAY. </p> <p>This year, Cyber Monday officially ends midnight on Monday, Nov. 27, 2023. </p> <p>According to the <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/cyber-monday-evolution-ncna1278160"" target=""_blank"">National Retail Federation</a> , the term Cyber Monday was coined in 2005. Since then, the cyber shopping holiday has been an annual event, taking place the Monday after Black Friday. </p> <p>According to the retailer, the countdown clock has the deals ending at 3 a.m. EST, which is midnight tonight PST.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Shannon Garlin is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Emma Stessman is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Madison San Miguel is the Editorial Assistant for Shop TODAY.

I bake one pie a year,” Lydon wrote in the post, adding that the first image in the set is 2023’s pie. The rosette-filled apple pie has the word “D---wad,” masterfully constructed out of pie dough, emblazoned across it.</p> <p class=""""><strong><em>Editor’s note:</em></strong><em> The below images contain obscene language.</em></p> <p class="""">“D---wad: My favorite name to call people when I’m angry and stuck in traffic,” wrote Lydon. In the slideshow, a total of 12 different pies are shown, all adorned with obscene language — from “F---wit” and “Penis” to “B----” and “F--- Off.”</p> <p class="""">“Asshat: My second favorite name to call people when I’m angry and stuck in traffic,” Lydon wrote about 2016’s pie. In other notes, she explains how her pie-making abilities have developed over the years, adding that using an X-acto knife instead of a chopstick to cut out letters was a “game changer” in 2018.</p> <p class="""">The reaction on Reddit was overwhelmingly positive and, of course, packed with profanities.</p> <p class="""">“I can’t wait for 2024’s choice word,” <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kaj9wgc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">commented</a> one Reddit user.</p> <p class="""">“Excellent evolution of typography here lol,” another noted.</p> <p class="""">“Your growth in pastry work is quite touching, c---,” someone else playfully <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kajazor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>, to which Lydon <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kav8bfi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">replied</a>, “Thank you, t---. I’m pretty proud of the progress. And grateful to my family for putting up with The Early Years. The first few pies were rough looking.”</p> <p class="""">Many others suggested bleepable words for future pies, like “<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kaj9cnx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">dips---</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kajqg6u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">nimrod</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kajzjwa/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">bollocks</a>” and more.</p> <p class="""">“How about tart? A little less spicy but I’m a sucker for puns,” <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/182kb3e/comment/kakaad0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">commented</a> another Redditor, trying out a little double entendre.</p> <p class="""">Lydon tells TODAY.com that the tradition began in 2012 as a prank she orchestrated with her immediate family. Her grandmother died a few years later, but the tradition lives on.</p> <p class="""">“When this all started, it was mom, dad, brother, grandma and everybody sitting down at the same table and eating. I was like, ‘Let’s see if we can make Grammy giggle,’” Lydon says about the very first pie, which read “F--- Off.”</p> <p class="""">“She was a sweet little Japanese lady,” Lydon explains, recalling that after they placed the pie in front of her, “she didn’t want to say anything, but she was like, ‘Oh my, well, I can see that you’ve tried really hard. And you put a lot of effort into it,’” which Lydon felt was “kind of a double-edged compliment.”</p> <p class="""">Lydon says she wishes her grandmother was able to see the progress she’s made with her profane pies, but she’s glad the rest of her family is able to bond over them.</p> <p class="""">“At this point, everyone’s kind of spread to different ends of the country and this is just one of those reminders that kind of brings everybody back together in spirit, at least,” she says.</p> <p class="""">Lydon says, as a big fan of vulgar vocabulary, she’s thrilled that her pies have been such a hit on Reddit.</p> <p class=""endmark"">“It’s fun seeing people so enthusiastic about it,” Lydon says, adding that some commenters said they were considering making this a tradition in their own families. “If we can make a few more people laugh because of rude words looking pretty, then I’m all for it.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Washington, D.C. native Joseph Lamour is a lover of food: its past, its present and the science behind it.

The participants also saw improvements in their insulin resistance, weight and blood pressure.</p> <p class="""">Almost three-quarters — 71% — of people who took part in Dry January said they slept better and 67% had more energy, according to a <a href=""https://www.sussex.ac.uk/news/all?id=47131"" target=""_blank"">University of Sussex study</a>. More than half, 58%, lost weight and 54% reported better skin.</p> <p class="""">People have a sense of achievement and they feel better and mentally sharper, said George F.

They’re salty, crunchy and able to stand up to a bevy of hearty dips, unlike their greasy potato chip counterparts that tend to break up in your hands. I eat them nearly every chance I get, from store-bought and homemade to street cart and gourmet.</p> <p class="""">This obsession with pretzels was fully realized after noshing on a soft variety at Alila Marea Beach Resort’s <a href=""https://vagarestaurant.com/"" target=""_blank"">VAGA Restaurant &amp; Bar</a> in Encinitas, California. They came as knots, dusted with honey mustard powder and served with a simple whipped butter — a harmonious balance of familiar flavors and textures but elevated to be the perfect starter to an oceanside meal.</p> <p class="""">Of course, you’re not going to find a pretzel this fresh and exciting in a mainstream grocery store, but I did want to pick founding chef Clauedette Zepeda’s brain about general shopping tips for finding the perfect twist.</p> <p class="""">“A hard pretzel is best when the snap is perfect and the thickness of the pretzel versus flavor dust is perfectly balanced,” she says.”I am a big fan of thin crispy pretzels or chunks of dried thick pretzel broken and generously dusted in flavoring powders that aren’t caking together.”</p> <p class="""">“I also don’t use pretzels for dip — if they are good, they are good enough on their own,” she adds.</p> <p class="""">As a self-proclaimed over-seasoner (my spice cabinet looks more like a CVS pharmacy), I share Zepeda’s sentiments, but it was my mission to find the best pretzel in <em>every </em>category and not just “best in flavor.”</p> <p class="""">Don’t get it twisted — nearly all sampled options were delicious, but these were the seven that left the biggest impression.</p> <p class="""">The way in which I housed a significant portion of this barrel in one sitting would rival <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/news/nathans-famous-hot-dog-eating-results-2023-miki-sudo-joey-chestnut-rcna92516"" target=""_blank"">Joey Chestnut at a Fourth of July eating competition</a>. The word “special” isn’t just a marketing gimmick — these rich, hearty delights excelled in nearly every category: distinct sourdough flavor, mighty but palatable crunch and an ideal cracker to salt ratio that was superior to most grocery store options. Pro tip: If you’re a fan of more robust pretzel flavor like Utz’s, be sure to also check out <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Unique-Pretzels-Splits-Delicious-Kosher/dp/B00DMTAV8M"" target=""_blank"">Unique Snacks Extra Dark Pretzel Splits</a>. They were a very, very close second and worthy of a mention in this taste test. </p> <p class="""">If you’re looking for a classic pretzel that can stand up to hearty dips like hummus, tapenade and queso, Snyder’s of Hanover has you more than covered. Sure, they’re somewhat no-frills and simple on their own, but they satisfy any sudden hankering for a quick carb, making them the go-to pretzel to always have on stand-by in your pantry.</p> <p class="""">My gluten-free friends are in for a real treat with Quinn’s whole-grain sorghum variety. In fact, gluten-free will feel less like a dietary restriction and more like an afterthought since these are scrumptious for practically every palate, personality and preference. The taste may initially come across as nutty and somewhat muted (at least compared to Snyder’s above), but give yourself another handful or two and the crunch alone will keep you coming back for more.</p> <p class="""">For those who want or need to cut back on their sodium content, all hope is not lost. Whole Foods’ 365 brand has concocted an unsalted pretzel that gives its more flavorful cousins a run for its money. Dare I say that I actually appreciated its blandness? It was a departure from what I’m obviously used to [insert embarrassingly large spice cabinet], but the slippery-smooth exterior had these going down with all too great of ease.</p> <p class="""">A seasoned pretzel is a superior pretzel, or at least that’s what I learned after diving into Dot’s seasoned pretzel twists. And while the “seasoning” may just be a winning combo of garlic powder, artificial butter and MSG, it’s a flavor profile that I never knew I needed in my life until I opened a bag and simply couldn’t stop indulging.</p> <p class="""">As an aforementioned over-seasoner who constantly seeks bold and exciting flavors, these may just be my all-time favorite snack. Spicy, salty and sprinkled with a generous amount of Buffalo sauce powder, they tick all the boxes when it comes to couch eating sessions. If the Buffalo is too aggressive in the heat department, opt for one of their other equally craveworthy flavors like honey mustard and onion or cheddar cheese.</p> <p class=""endmark"">Migrating from chips to pretzels may be difficult for potato loyalists, so a light, crispy and airy hybrid of the two should accommodate most snacking preferences.

I will cherish how she and Dad raised their children. They've given us such a great example of how a couple should relate,"" Chip Carter said during the service. </p> <p class="""">Chip Carter was photographed giving his father a tender kiss on the head at the service.</p> <p class="""">The couple’s only daughter, Amy Carter, was also on hand to speak about her late mother, as was grandson Jason Carter. A few of Rosalynn Carter's great-grandchildren offered readings of Scripture.</p> <p class="""">Amy Carter read a letter her dad wrote 75 years ago to his wife, which included the lines, ""When I see you, I fall in love with you all over again. Does that seem strange to you? It doesn't to me.""</p> <p class="""">The Carters, who celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary in July, were <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/jimmy-carter-rosalynn-carter-relationship-timeline-rcna101205"" target=""_blank"">the longest-married couple in presidential history</a>. </p> <p class="""">During their marriage, the Carters welcomed four children: sons John (also known as Jack), 76; James (aka Chip), 73; and Donnel (aka Jeff), 71; and daughter Amy, 56. They shared nearly a dozen grandchildren and even more great-grandchildren.</p> <p class="""">Born on Oct. 1, 1924, Jimmy Carter ventured far and high from his roots in the small, dusty town of Plains, Georgia. Throughout his political career, Carter set his focus on energy conservation, education and the expansion of human rights. All the while, he held tightly onto his regard for family, and he notoriously relied on the support of his wife to propel and sustain his efforts. As a result, Carter's marriage and family life have been a point of admiration, especially for the younger members of his family. </p> <p class="""">In August, the couple's grandson Josh Carter spoke about the close-knit dynamic the couple were able to create for the large family in an interview with <a href=""https://people.com/jimmy-rosalynn-carter-health-update-exclusive-7692868"" target=""_blank"">People</a>.</p> <p class="""">“Every year, we got together our entire family and would go somewhere amazing,"" he told the outlet, adding, ""And those family trips are one of my most cherished memories.”</p> <p class="""">Read on to learn about Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter's children and grandchildren.</p> <p class="""">The Carters, who <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/news/jimmy-carter-rosalynn-carter-relationship-timeline-rcna101205"" target=""_blank"">met when Jimmy Carter was 3 and Rosalynn Carter just a newborn</a>, married in 1946 shortly after the future president graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. </p> <p class="""">The military couple's early years together were spent on Navy bases in Norfolk, Virginia; Honolulu; and San Diego.</p> <p class="""">They welcomed three sons, Jack, Chip and Jeff, from 1947 to 1952, and their only daughter, Amy, in 1967.</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter entered into politics in the early 1960s, first serving as a Georgia state senator from 1963 until 1967 and later as governor of Georgia from 1971 until 1975. He served as president from 1977 until 1981.</p> <p class="""">Here's a look at the family they created.</p> <p class="""">Born in 1947, the Carters' oldest child, Jack Carter, followed his father into politics. He <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna14358246#.X24lepNKh-U"" target=""_blank"">was the 2006 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada</a>, but lost in the general election.</p> <p class="""">He had son Jason and daughter Sarah with his first wife, Judy Langford. The couple divorced and Carter went on to marry Elizabeth Brasfield — who was mother to John and Sarah Chuldenko. </p> <p class="""">James Earl “Chip” Carter III was born in 1950 in Honolulu. According to a 2008 interview with Chip Carter compiled in the ""<a href=""https://dlg.usg.edu/record/gych_rogp_036#text"" target=""_blank"">Reflections on Georgia Politics oral history collection</a>,"" the president's son spoke about being involved in his father's political career at the age of 16.</p> <p class="""">""I had a congressional district they assign me and I would stop in every single store I saw and give out a brochure and tell them to vote for my father and I got $22.00 a week for expenses, plus a gas credit card,"" he recalled.</p> <p class="""">Chip Carter mourned the death of his mother following news of her passing.</p> <p class="""">“Besides being a loving mother and extraordinary First Lady, my mother was a great humanitarian in her own right,” he <a href=""https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2023/statement-rosalynn-carter-111923.html"" target=""_blank"">said in a statement</a> through the Carter Center. “Her life of service and compassion was an example for all Americans. She will be sorely missed not only by our family but by the many people who have better mental health care and access to resources for caregiving today.”</p> <p class="""">Donnel Jeffrey “Jeff” Carter was born in 1952. He would go on to create a company called Computer Mapping Consultants and marry wife Annette Davis, with whom he had three kids, one of whom died in 2015. Annette died in 2021. </p> <p class="""">The couple met on the first day of school at Georgia Southwestern State University in the early 1970s.</p> <p class="""">“Jeff saw her across the student center while he was playing spades, and he told his friends to turn around and look at that pretty girl that just walked in.

She was a familiar face in the White House while her father was president. Amy Carter also gained notoriety for her political activism, getting arrested in 1986 for protesting CIA recruitment at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

In 2014, the father of two was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, but lost in the general election.

She is also someone who will say so if something is not right. She may say it quietly and in private, but there will be no mistaking it. I like to think that I’m a little bit like her.”<strong>  </strong></p> <p class="""">James Carter is the son of Chip Carter and Chip's ex-wife Caron Carter.

T. Edvardsson's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, is leading to binge-watches.</p> <p class="""">The six-episode miniseries follows what happens when a 19-year-old girl, Stella Sandell (Alexandra Karlsson Tyrefors), is accused of murdering her 32-year-old boyfriend Chris Olsen (Christian Fandango) — and there's evidence she really did. The accusation fractures her family, comprised of a priest dad Adam (Björn Bengtsson) and lawyer mom Ulrika (Lo Kauppi).</p> <p class="""">But this isn't the first time Stella's family faced a difficult crossroads. Here's all you need to know about the exciting new series sweeping Netflix. </p> <p class="""">The Sandells are, as the title suggests, a seemingly normal family. </p> <p class="""">But an event from their daughter Stella's past caused a divide — one that reverberates to the present day, when she has been accused of murder. </p> <p class="""">Episode One sets up the turning point in Stella's life. Stella, then 15, attends handball camp (it's a church camp in the novel). There, she is sexually assaulted by an older counselor.</p> <p class="""">Stella tells her parents about the event, but they choose not to call the police because her mom thinks she would suffer additional trauma and the case against the counselor would ultimately fall through without sufficient evidence. </p> <p class="""">Throughout the remainder of the series, Stella's relationship with her parents, men and herself are all profoundly impacted by this tragic decision.</p> <p class="""">Flash forward four years in the future, the show cuts to Stella's 19th birthday, the night she first meets Christoffer Olsen (Christian Fandango Sundgren) and starts dating him. In that time, he's stabbed to death and Stella is accused of murder.</p> <p class="""">Her parents are left reeling as they attempt to protect their daughter while also acknowledging their own shortcomings and secrets.</p> <p class="""">What is it based on?</p> <p class="""">The series is based on the bestselling book of the same name by Swedish author M.T. Edvardsson, which was originally published in 2019.

A Bundt is a doughnut-shaped, festive dessert, easy enough to whip up on a weeknight, but special enough to serve at the end of a celebratory meal.</p> <p class="""">Similar to <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/desserts/best-cake-recipes-rcna126858"" target=""_blank"">pound cakes</a>, Bundt cakes are typically a bit more lofty, thanks to the special pans they’re baked in, giving the cake its signature doughnut-esque hole in the middle, and plenty of decorative edges all around. And yes, that hole has a purpose. The special pan makes sure the cake bakes evenly through (no gooey middles here) and that negative space doesn’t need to be filled when you flip the cake out of the pan to serve it. Plus, it looks pretty and that doesn’t hurt either.</p> <p class="""">Traditional Bundt cakes may be smooth or have simple ridges, but new kitchenware lets home cooks bake their Bundt in pans creating a plethora of elaborate designs — from pumpkins to snowflakes to  trees, the possibilities are nearly endless. </p> <p class="""">Whatever the pan, Bundt cakes are also fantastic to decorate, particularly if your cake icing skills are lacking. The round, crisp exterior of the cake makes it a wonderful canvas to drizzle icings on, dress up with sprinkles, douse in syrup, dust with powdered sugar or adorn with candied fruits. The result is always admirable, particularly with a less-is-more mentality.</p> <p class="""">Bundts work as well for <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/desserts/hoda-kotb-reveals-make-best-birthday-cakes-tonight-show-rcna21145"" target=""_blank"">birthdays</a> as any other cake. A circle of candles crowning the top is photo-worthy. But the cakes can also be everyday loaves, sliceable right off the counter for breakfast or a snack. </p> <p class="""">Here are some of the best Bundt cake recipes to bake.</p> <p class="""">Secret’s out. This decadent chocolate cake is superb. Like the best desserts, it looks just as good as it tastes. A smattering of colorful sprinkles on top of this Bundt make it extra festive for a birthday party.</p> <p class="""">Spritzes are just as fun to eat as they are to drink. This Bundt cake takes all the flavors of <a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/aperol-spritz-recipe-t257642"" target=""_blank"">summer’s most popular drink</a> and turns them into a dessert that’s easy to enjoy at happy hour and around the clock. Pair with the Italian cocktail, if you like. </p> <p class="""">Like a giant chocolate chip cookie, this Bundt is super comforting. And it’s an easy way to dress up boxed cake mix to look indistinguishable from a homemade treat. A box of instant chocolate pudding makes it extra moist.</p> <p class="""">This cake is almost too pretty to slice into, thanks to the fresh mint leaves on top. Inspired by the timeless <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/steve-kornacki-shares-fun-kentucky-derby-trivia-172936773875"" target=""_blank"">Kentucky Derby</a> cocktail, this recipe calls for bourbon in the batter for a bold addition to the treat. A mint-bourbon syrup to finish is an added nod to the boozy beverage.</p> <p class="""">This festive pecan cake is a nice addition to any winter meal. It’s studded with pecans, golden raisins and canned crushed pineapple for a sweet bite. Dress this cake up with candied pecans for a sugary garnish.</p> <p class="""">Move aside, <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/royal-family-recipe-gingerbread-cookies-served-christmas-queen-t145300"" target=""_blank"">gingerbread men</a>. Straight out of TODAY’s kitchen, this gingerbread Bundt cake ushers in the holiday season with the warm aroma and flavors of the season. Better yet, it’s just as delicious for dessert as it is for breakfast the next day. Garnished with maple glaze and decorative, edible snowflakes makes this cake gift-worthy. </p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.today.com/recipes/classic-carrot-cake-cream-cheese-frosting-t81271"" target=""_blank"">Carrot cake</a> doesn’t have to be sliced into squares and smothered with thick cream cheese frosting. Spice it up with freshly grated ginger and a dusting of confectioners’ sugar for a lighter take on this classic treat. Another trick? Carrot purée, which adds sweetness and an intense orange hue. It’s so smooth that you’ll forget you’re eating veggies. </p> <p class="""">Good morning, gorgeous Bundt. This Bundt cake recipe transforms a box of cake mix and a can of pumpkin purée into a one-of-a-kind autumnal treat. Homemade cinnamon frosting is the cherry on top. </p> <p class="""">For an even more indulgent gingerbread treat, enjoy a slice of this spiced gingerbread cake. A festive Bundt pan can elevate this recipe, which uses fresh ginger and crystallized ginger for extra spice. Serve with powdered sugar and whipped cream.</p> <p class="""">Browning butter takes a few extra minutes but is worth the toasty results. You can do this on the stovetop in less than five minutes. The maple flavor in this cake isn’t subtle, which is just how we like it, and the golden-hued glaze enhances the autumnal notes. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or warm cider.  </p> <p class="""">Digging into  this cake is like a big, warm hug. The batter is lush with tart apples, cinnamon and cardamom. And the streusel topping is so good, you may want to double the batch. </p> <p class="""">This <a href=""https://www.today.com/food/elizabeth-heiskell-retro-70s-inspired-recipes-t294903"" target=""_blank"">retro recipe</a> transforms lemon-lime soda into a sweet and tangy cake. A lemony glaze using soda, sugar and lemon juice adds to the zingy flavor. Garnish with lemon peels or candied lemons for extra flare. </p> <p class="""">If you love pumpkin, you’ll probably want to dig into this sweet potato cake. Mashed sweet potatoes add soft sweetness and a nice hue to this Bundt that’s enriched with a cinnamon swirl. The maple glaze on top makes this cake extra autumnal. </p> <p class="""">Apples and honey make a wonderful pairing, especially in a cake. Pumpkin pie spice and brown sugar add another element of coziness, while olive oil keeps the batter super moist. Splurge for high-quality olive oil and honey and you’ll taste the difference.</p> <p class="""">This sweet recipe from Giada De Laurentiis tastes sophisticated but is easy to execute. Tart apples such as Granny Smiths work well in this recipe alongside chopped walnuts. The homemade cream cheese-based icing brings it all together and looks professional to boot. </p> <p class=""endmark"">Is it bread? Is it cake? Does it matter? This morning loaf-inspired cake baked in a Bundt pan is so special, and pops in your mouth with each bite of zingy lemons and seeds. Evaporated milk adds a subtle sweetness and richness to the cake.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Melissa Kravitz Hoeffner is a writer and recipe developer.

Many vegans also follow the regimen because of concerns about animal welfare and the environment.</p> <p class="""">Nutritionists tend to be fans of people exploring a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/interested-plant-based-diet-here-s-what-you-need-know-t199909"" target=""_blank"">plant-based diet</a>, but skeptical of just diving into the vegan lifestyle for a month without much preparation or modification.</p> <p class="""">The name is catchy, but Veganuary is not a realistic goal for most people, says NBC News health and nutrition editor Madelyn Fernstrom, Ph.D.</p> <p class="""">“It’s very rigid, and while it can be healthy, the interested-but-uneducated consumer is at risk for nutritional deficiencies,” Fernstrom tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">“The risk of <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-much-vitamin-b12-do-we-need-what-s-best-t190657"" target=""_blank"">vitamin B12</a> deficiency is high, along with calcium and sometimes adequate protein intake. A strictly vegan diet takes a lot of preplanning and wide selection of plant based foods.”</p> <p class="""">Research links going meat-free to an <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-downside-plant-based-diets-t203871"" target=""_blank"">increased risk of bone fractures</a>.</p> <p class="""">Going this extreme all at once can actually turn people off, so making just a few changes may be better, says Beth Kitchin, a registered dietitian nutritionist and retired assistant professor of nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p> <p class="""">“A vegan diet can be very healthy, but it’s not easy. Easing into it may give you better long-term benefits, because you might get frustrated if you just jump in full force,” Kitchin says.</p> <p class="""">Still, Veganuary is worth a try if you want to test-drive this lifestyle, adds Ashley Gearhardt, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan and director of its Food and Addiction Science &amp; Treatment Lab.</p> <p class="""">A 30-day trial run can change people’s behavior, Gearhardt notes, but she was concerned most would replace meat and cheese with “ultra-processed vegan junk food” filled with sugar, fat and salt, and think they were eating healthy.</p> <p class="""">“Spending all month eating vegan hot dogs, vegan ice cream and vegan french fries is not going to improve health,” Gearhardt warns.</p> <p class="""">All of the experts advised easing into it, rather than going all in all at once. If a totally plant-based diet feels too restrictive and you are deprived, you won’t stick with it.</p> <p class="""">Popular modifications include:</p> <p class="""">The vegan diet may not be right for people with a history of eating disorders because the restrictions could trigger old symptoms.</p> <p class="""">Some nutrient needs are harder to meet for vegans, so it’s a good idea to talk with a registered dietitian, especially if you want to adopt this diet as a long-term lifestyle.</p> <p class="""">Look for healthy tips on websites like <a href=""https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/vegging-out-tips-on-switching-to-a-meatless-diet"" target=""_blank"">eatright.org</a>, which is maintained by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p> <p class="""">Vitamin B12 is often deficient without animal proteins, for example, and it takes almost three cups of broccoli or seven cups of arugula to match the calcium in one cup of milk. “Sometimes supplements must be added, so pay attention to your needs,"" Fernstrom says.</p> <p class="""">Nutrient-rich <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-s-good-you-planet-t179506"" target=""_blank"">plant sources of protein</a> include tofu, beans, quinoa, almonds and pumpkin seeds. Avoid the mistake of choosing foods only because they are plant-based — rather, look for nutrient value like proteins, fiber, heart healthy fats, and vitamins and minerals, Fernstrom notes.</p> <p class="""">A vegan diet can be very filling because it can be very high in fiber, Kitchin says. Many favorites like peanut butter, hummus and air-popped popcorn are naturally vegan. Restaurants are also increasingly offering vegan options.</p> <p class="""">Gearhardt’s research has found people who shift to a healthier diet can initially experience withdrawal-like symptoms, including irritability, cravings and headaches. They often go away within two weeks.</p> <p class="""">“It might take a little bit of time for your taste buds to adjust to not getting unnaturally high hits of sugar, fat and salt, but eventually you’ll be surprised by how much pleasure you can get from these foods,” Gearhardt says.</p> <p class="""">“It’s easier to make these new changes a less effortful habit the longer you do it.”</p> <p class=""endmark""><em>This story was originally published on Jan. 6, 2020, and has been updated.</em></p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">A.

""I would say the jury is still out, but there is a lot of compelling evidence to suggest that is going to be favorable for cardiometabolic health.""</p> <p class="""">Studies and clinical trials suggest intermittent fasting has ""broad-spectrum benefits"" for health problems including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and neurologic disorders, according to a <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1905136"" target=""_blank"">review of research</a> in humans and animals published in 2019 in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p> <p class="""">The powerful health effects appear to come from the body flipping a ""metabolic switch"" during fasting — or shifting away from using sugar as its main source of energy and instead converting fat for fuel when a person's stomach is empty.</p> <p class="""">But most people still eat throughout the day and miss out on the health benefits of a fasting window, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/intermittent-fasting-good-you-regimen-boosts-weight-loss-disease-resistance-t170536"" target=""_blank"">said lead author Mark Mattson</a>, adjunct professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p> <p class="""">Eating only within an eight-hour window can help people with Type 2 diabetes lose weight and manage their blood sugar, according to a <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2811116"" target=""_blank"">study</a> published in JAMA Network Open in October 2023.</p> <p class="""">The clinical trial involved 75 adults with Type 2 diabetes and obesity who were randomly divided into three groups for six months. One group could eat whatever they wanted and how much they wanted, but only between noon and 8 p.m. The second group was instructed to eat 25% fewer calories than normal, and the rest stuck to their usual eating routine.</p> <p class="""">The participants' weight and blood sugar levels were measured at baseline, and then regularly throughout the six-month trial.</p> <p class="""">""We found that the fasting group lost twice as much weight as standard care (daily calorie counting), but both groups improved HbA1c, a key diabetes risk parameter, similarly,"" Varady, a co-author of the study, tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/managing-blood-sugar/a1c.html"" target=""_blank"">HbA1c</a> measures a person's average blood sugar levels over the past three months. It fell about 0.7% for both groups. But when it came to weight, the fasting group lost about 10 pounds over six months on average, compared to less than 6 pounds for the calorie-counting group.</p> <p class="""">Eating fewer calories is commonly prescribed as the first line of defense in Type 2 diabetes treatment, but many patients struggle with it so time-restricted eating may offer a ""refreshing alternative,"" the paper notes.</p> <p class="""">There were no serious adverse events reported during the trial, so the study shows intermittent fasting is safe in this population group, Varady says. But she advises people with diabetes to always check with their doctors before starting time-restricted eating.</p> <p class="""">The findings need to be confirmed by larger trials with longer follow-up, the authors note.</p> <p class="""">Intermittent fasting isn't for people with Type 1 diabetes who take insulin because it may result in unsafe levels of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, during the fasting period, <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/intermittent-fasting-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work"" target=""_blank"">Mattson says</a>.</p> <p class="""">Intermittent fasting can be easy to follow, provide daily structure and often doesn’t require any <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-many-calories-should-you-eat-day-t134264"" target=""_blank"">calorie counting</a>. It also reconnects people with true, biological hunger and makes it easier to recognize fullness, so they stop eating sooner, Fernstrom notes.</p> <p class="""">Unlike many fad diets, intermittent fasting doesn’t lead to eating disorders or slow down a person’s metabolism, Varady says. She's the co-author of a <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-022-00638-x"" target=""_blank"">2022 review of studies</a> that found intermittent fasting is generally safe and produces few gastrointestinal, neurological, hormonal or metabolic adverse effects.</p> <p class="""">Varady dabbles with intermittent fasting herself, typically for a few weeks after the holidays to lose a few pounds.</p> <p class="""">If you're ready to try 16:8 intermittent fasting, Varady has some tips to make sure you do it in a way that is healthy and works with your life.</p> <p class="""">Experts advise picking an eating window that lets you finish your meals fairly early, such as 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. or earlier, because the body is <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/timing-meals-may-be-factor-losing-weight-t106879"" target=""_blank"">less efficient at processing sugar</a> as the day goes by.</p> <p class="""">In an ""absolute ideal world,"" people would eat breakfast, take in most of their calories during the first part of the day, have a very light dinner — if any at all — and then fast for the rest of the evening, Cheng says. She calls that potentially the best timing, but knows many people derive a psychological benefit from sitting around the table at dinner.</p> <p class="""">So it's important to pick a window of time that works for your schedule. If you're a very early riser, for example, it may be difficult to wait until noon to eat.</p> <p class="""">Most people get hungry about half an hour after they finish working out and may find it too hard to stick to their plan if they can’t eat anything at all afterward, Varady notes. That's why it's important to exercise before you eat.</p> <p class="""">If you’re on the 16:8 plan, exercise before your eating window or make sure to finish your workout at least 90 minutes before your eating window ends for the day.</p> <p class="""">Fasting for 16 hours may sound tough, but if you're getting the recommended seven or more hours of slumber per night, you'll be asleep for about half of it.</p> <p class="""">If you experience moments of low energy, you can try:</p> <p class="""">Many people are used to grazing and nibbling all day long, but there's no snacking during the fasting periods of intermittent fasting. Here are some ways to avoid getting ""hangry:""</p> <p class="""">Remember, being ""a little hungry"" is the best thing that can happen to you, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/are-you-really-hungry-5-questions-ask-yourself-you-eat-t59076"" target=""_blank"">wrote Fernstrom</a>, calling it a ""true mind-body connection"" that helps you recognize fullness.</p> <p class="""">Don't drink any alcohol during a fasting window or a fasting day since it's high in calories and has no nutritional value, Varady advises. During non-fasting periods, women should limit their alcohol intake to one drink a day; men shouldn't have more than two.</p> <p class="""">Here's more information to know before you commit. Always check with your doctor before starting a diet.</p> <p class="""">Researchers say intermittent fasting <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Abstract/2020/11000/The_Safety_and_Efficacy_of_Intermittent_Fasting.5.aspx"" target=""_blank"">is not for everyone</a>, including:</p> <p class="""">If the 16:8 plan doesn't appeal to you, there are other ways of intermittent fasting.

They spotted Rosalynn standing outside the Methodist Church and invited her to join them to see a movie.</p> <p class="""">At breakfast the next morning, Jimmy Carter gushed about Rosalynn to his mom. ""She's the one I'm going to marry,"" he said.</p> <p class="""">In his memoir, Jimmy Carter revealed that he was captivated by his future wife's beauty and brains. ""Rosalynn was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussions on the rumble seat of the Ford Coupe,"" he wrote in his memoir.</p> <p class="""">The former president told The Washington Post that he believed the couple's marriage, which took place in July 1946 when he was 21 and she was 18, was meant to be. </p> <p class="""">""I’ve always thought that,"" he said.</p> <p class="""">The young military couple began married life on the Navy base in Norfolk, Virginia, later moving to other bases in Honolulu and San Diego.</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter was a young lieutenant and his wife a stay-at-home mom to the pair's sons.

He would take my advice about things.""</p> <p class="""">The couple took that partnership style into politics when Jimmy Carter entered office in the early 1960s.</p> <p class="""">He served as a Georgia state senator from 1963 until 1967 and as governor of Georgia from 1971 until 1975 before making his way to the White House as the 39th president from 1977 until 1981.</p> <p class="""">Rosalynn Carter proved to be a capable campaigner and policy advocate. </p> <p class="""">“I love it. I love campaigning,"" the former first lady told The Associated Press. ""I had the best time. I was in all the states in the United States. I campaigned solid every day the last time we ran.""</p> <p class="""">The couple's son James Carter, who goes by the nickname Chip, told The Washington Post that his mom was instrumental in getting his father elected.</p> <p class="""">""Dad started to change when he ran for governor, because Mom was a much better politician than he was,” he said. “She cared about him getting elected and reelected, and he cared about the Panama Canal.”</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter regarded Rosalynn Carter as an unofficial adviser during his years in the White House, even asking her to attend cabinet meetings.</p> <p class="""">The couple told <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/03/inseparable/"" target=""_blank"">The W</a><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/03/inseparable/"" target=""_blank"">ashington Post</a> that while in the White House, they frequently discussed — and disagreed about — the policies of the Carter administration over one-on-one lunches every Thursday in the Oval Office.</p> <p class="""">“She opposed my policies a lot when I was in the White House, but never publicly,” said the former president.</p> <p class="""">“We would sit on the Truman Balcony in the afternoon and talk about what we did,” said Rosalynn Carter. “I told him what I thought.”</p> <p class="""">Jimmy Carter served only one term in the White House, losing the 1980 presidential election to his opponent, Ronald Reagan.</p> <p class="""">After he and Rosalynn Carter left politics, they returned to their hometown of Plains.</p> <p class="""">The inseparable couple, then in their mid-50s, devoted themselves to humanitarian work. In 1982, they founded the Carter Center, a not-for-profit human rights organization.</p> <p class="""">The couple are also perhaps the most famous volunteers for Habitat for Humanity, and have been photographed joining the organization as it builds houses around the world.</p> <p class="""">In 2002, Jimmy Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work “to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development” through the Carter Center.</p> <p class="""">The longest-living president in U.S. history, Jimmy Carter and his wife of nearly 80 years remained devoted to one another as each faced illness in their senior years. </p> <p class="""">On Feb. 18, it was announced that the former president would <a href=""https://www.today.com/news/politics/jimmy-carter-hospice-rcna71346"" target=""_blank"">receive hospice care</a> at the Plains home he shared with the former first lady, who was <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/rosalynn-carter-jimmy-carter-wife-dementia-rcna86873"" target=""_blank"">diagnosed with dementia</a> this year.

After three seasons as a full-time cast member, she made scattered appearances over the course of many seasons through the years — the most recent in Season 19's ""Sunk Cost Fallacy."" </p> <p class="""">Cabot not only stuck to following the law in her role as the assistant district attorney, but she also showed a great amount of compassion for the victims, which eventually led to her character working in secret to help women escape abusive partners after she no longer worked as an ADA. </p> <p class="""">And off-screen, March began working with causes important to her at her core. </p> <p class="""">She teamed up with OneKid OneWorld, which aims to help kids in Kenya and Central America by providing basic education essentials, about 16 years ago through her friendships with two of the group’s co-founders.</p> <p class="""">""Between that and advocacy for women and girls and body autonomy and education, it's just really in my wheelhouse for what's important to me,"" she explains, adding her first trip to Kenya was ""the most extraordinary experience."" </p> <p class="""">In the Season 11 ""SVU"" episode ""Witness,"" Cabot helps a woman who is from the Democratic Republic of Congo agree to testify after witnessing a rape. The woman fears for her safety, as she is not a legal U.S. citizen and also experienced the horrors of rape while living in Congo. </p> <p class="""">""It's funny you say that because one of the boards I most recently joined is the <a href=""https://panzifoundation.org/"" target=""_blank"">Panzi Foundation</a>, and that was centered in and founded in the DRC,"" March says, adding the organization was founded ""against the use of rape as a tool of war."" </p> <p class="""">""It's something I'm really proud of,"" she explains about her work with the group, ""and there it is, years ago in this episode of the show."" </p> <p class="""">When asked if March influenced any of the ""SVU"" storylines years ago, she says it's in fact the opposite. </p> <p class="""">""I think those stories influenced me,"" she says, referencing that many of the show's episodes are ""ripped from the headlines."" </p> <p class="""">""So much of what we were working on and talking about was grounded in real-life problems and real situations,"" March says. ""It's easy enough to be an actor pretending around them, but when you think about the real-life consequences and the people suffering through that, I felt compelled to take more concrete action outside of just my work.""</p> <p class="""">One of March's co-stars and friends who has also been influenced in her real life by the show's subject matter is ""SVU"" lead <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/mariska-hargitay-necklace-video-glamour-women-year-awards-rcna124157"" target=""_blank"">Mariska Hargitay</a> (<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/mariska-hargitay-teases-benson-stabler-law-and-order-svu-hashtags-rcna71977"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Benson</a>), who founded the Joyful Heart Foundation in 2004 to help educate society on sexual assault and domestic violence. The two remain in touch to this day.</p> <p class="""">March says she ""has the utmost respect"" for Hargitay and her ""huge heart."" </p> <p class="""">""She's an absolute delight to be around,"" she explains, adding, ""She's one of the funniest people I've ever met in my entire life. She has the best sense of humor and the show is not a great place to showcase that, but she cracks me up.""</p> <p class="""">""I really believe in the power of female friendship and honesty and being vulnerable to one another and being able to raise each other up,"" she says, referencing the importance of her closeness with other women in her life like her sister, mother and sorority sisters. </p> <p class="""">""The one thing you really can't do with your female friends is you can't BS them,"" March adds. ""It's where you come to tell the truth and be supportive, and if you are around people who are really doing that, other women, then you can do it for them, too."" </p> <p class="""">Another one of March's close female friends is ""Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime"" makeup artist Rebecca Perkins. The two worked together for years on ""SVU,"" and eventually started a business together, SheSpoke, making custom lipsticks. The beauty brand just dropped <a href=""https://shespokemakeup.com/products/sugarplumholiday2023"" target=""_blank"">a special lipstick color, Sugarplum</a>, and a portion of the proceeds will go to the OneGirl OnePad program, which is an initiative from OneKid OneWorld that hopes to eliminate period poverty. March went to Kenya for a few weeks to work with OneGirl OnePad. She has also spent time in the DRC and Rwanda. </p> <p class="""">March and Perkins wanted to change the way beauty products are usually advertised and close the gap in the typical messaging. </p> <p class="""">""It's not just to be pretty for boys,"" March says. </p> <p class="""">""We thought makeup should be a tool of self-expression and fun, which is why we called the company SheSpoke,"" she adds. </p> <p class="""">When asked if Perkins has tried to talk her into coming on ""OC,"" March says, ""Oh, yeah! I get a lot of the good on-set hot goss from Rebecca. She texts all the time."" </p> <p class="""">""I've been working with Becca on set and as a business partner for probably ... 15 years,"" she adds. ""It's fun to hear from her perspective what's going on."" </p> <p class="""">In May 2022, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/chris-meloni-story-law-order-set-pics-mariska-hargitay-rcna29078"" target=""_blank"">TODAY.com asked ""Organized Crime"" star Chris Meloni (Elliot Stabler)</a> whom he'd like to see from his original run on ""SVU"" pop up on ""OC,"" and he said March. It was only right we bring this up during our conversation with her. </p> <p class="""">""It's very mutual — I would love to see Chris again,"" March answers. As for if she would be down to appear on ""OC,"" March says, ""Hell, yeah!""</p> <p class="""">""This is true of both Chris and Mariska, but Chris really took his job seriously,"" she explains about her favorite part of working with Meloni. </p> <p class="""">""It was important to him that the character be a good balance to Benson, and both of them really worked hard to create this, I think, excellent symbiotic relationship that reads on screen,"" she continues, ""which is why their chemistry is so great for so many seasons. And Chris took that really seriously."" </p> <p class="""">Another ""SVU"" cast member March's Cabot shared scenes with was Judge Lena Petrovsky, who was portrayed by Joanna Merlin. Merlin died in October at 92, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/theater/joanna-merlin-dead.html"" target=""_blank"">according to The New York Times</a>. </p> <p class="""">""I'm in my office right now, and I'm literally looking at her book,"" March says about Merlin. ""Joanna was so cool, and she was such a wonderful person. She signed the book, actually, 'Your partner in crime. With love and affection, Joanna.'"" </p> <p class="""">""I was really young when I started on 'SVU.'... And I didn't have any on-camera experience,"" March adds. ""Joanna was so kind to me and so patient and such a great scene partner.""</p> <p class="""">""So much of what we did was just in an office with each other and we'd have these really late nights and we'd be working and we'd be very tired — and she was the most extraordinary teacher. Maybe some of that comes across on screen."" </p> <p class="""">In between watching March in old episodes of ""SVU,"" fans can soon catch her in the movie ""Origin"" from Ava DuVernay. </p> <p class="""">March plays a literary agent in the film, which depicts how author Isabel Wilkerson's 2020 bestselling nonfiction book, ""Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent,"" came to be. </p> <p class="""">""There is nothing not to like about working with Ava,"" March says, noting DuVernay's ability to command an entire room. </p> <p class=""endmark"">""She's directing us, she's directing the extras, she's working on the camera, she's dealing with the lights,"" she continues. ""She's absolutely untiring. Her voice is astonishing.

After eight brutal days in the mountains of New Zealand, only five contestants made it to the finale of Fox's ""Special Forces: World's Toughest Test,"" which aired Nov. 27.</p> <p class="""">The second season of “Special Forces” challenged 14 celebrities to complete over a week of military training, performing exercises from “the playbook of the Special Forces selection process,” per Fox. The recruits are led by a team of ex-Special Forces operatives.</p> <p class="""">In the end, only three celebrity contestants ""passed"" the test and successfully completed the course.</p> <p class="""">Here's what happened.</p> <p class="""">""Won"" might not be the word. <em>Completed </em>is more like it. </p> <p class="""">At the start of the show's eighth and final episode, Olympic speed skater Erin Jackson, ""Bachelor"" alum Nick Viall, ""Bachelorette"" alum Tyler Cameron, ""Vanderpump Rules"" star Tom Sandoval and dancer, singer and YouTuber JoJo Siwa were left standing. </p> <p class="""">Sandoval and Siwa made shocking exits during the show's eighth and final episode. </p> <p class="""">That made Viall, Jackson and Cameron sole remaining trio, worthy of being named to Special Forces.</p> <p class="""">But these celebrities didn't make it to the end without a fight. </p> <p class="""">For their last challenge, as with last season, the five had to endure military-grade interrogation during a 24-hour challenge.

Since there was only seven minutes left in the game, they were essentially ejections. </p> <p class="""">The melee started when the Panthers' Dmitry Kulikov slammed Ottawa's Brady Tkachuk into the boards, causing both teams to rush in and start swinging at each other. As the officials stood in between several players, they attempted to throw punches past them at opposing players. </p> <p class="""">The Panthers were leading by four goals at the time, and the two teams played shorthanded the rest of the way as Florida skated to a 5-0 victory. </p> <p class="""">The group of 10 players ejected for the fights were not even the only ones tossed from the game. Senators forward Zack MacEwen was ejected earlier in the third period. </p> <p class="""">It got so chippy that even a pair of brothers started exchanging words.

Taryn Imwalle and Savannah Czyzewicz first met by visiting each others' ""islands"" on Nintendo's ""Animal Crossing"" in 2020. Three years later, they finally came face-to-face — when one went to the other's wedding. </p> <p class="""">Imwalle, 31, and Czyzewicz, 28, both lost their jobs during COVID-19's first lockdown in 2020, and both turned to ""Animal Crossing"" to occupy their new swaths of time. The game series is known for its relaxing nature, offering users an escape into a gentle, cozy (and fictional) world.</p> <p class="""">""I didn't have any responsibilities,"" Czyzewicz tells TODAY.com. ""I literally played 'Animal Crossing' for 24 hours a day. That's all I did, it was great.""</p> <p class="""">""Animal Crossing: New Horizons,"" which released in March 2020, <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/grandma-loves-playing-nintendo-s-animal-crossing-game-t178182"" target=""_blank"">took over the video game world</a> as much of the world was stuck indoors. In the game, players tend to their own islands, encountering various animal neighbors and competing tasks, all while making their home uniquely theirs.</p> <p class="""">Players can visit each others' islands through ""dodo codes,"" and either trade goods or simply show off.</p> <p class="""">Imwalle, who lives in Ohio, and Czyzewicz, who lives in Arizona, met on the ""Animal Crossing"" Reddit group, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/"" target=""_blank"">which now boasts more than 2 million members</a>. In one of the group's many threads, players trade dodo codes — think of it as instant teleportation.</p> <p class="""">""We just clicked and the conversation never stopped,"" Czyzewicz says. ""We're both very loud and dramatic. And we both have very vibrant personalities, and we both really love to complain.""</p> <p class="""">""So I think it was just kind of that shared experience of playing 'Animal Crossing' every day, but also we both got laid off. We were in the same place mentally and that drove conversation as well,"" she continues.</p> <p class="""">The two started to play the game together over FaceTime. During those conversations, they found they went from casual internet friends to actual close friends.</p> <p class="""">""Being completely isolated from everybody, except for the people you were quarantining with, it was just a very unique situation,"" Imwalle tells TODAY.com. ""I honestly don't know if we would have befriended each other in the same way had it been normal times.""</p> <p class="""">""Because we both loved the game and still love the game so much, I think we probably would still have been friends,"" Czyzewicz replies.</p> <p class=""pullquote__quote"" data-testid=""pullquote-quote"">Just that feeling when you meet that you have known them for a long time. It's just an instant, almost karmic connection. It's this feeling like you have known them your whole life.</p> <p class=""pullquote__attribution""><cite class=""pullquote__cite"" data-testid=""pullquote-attribution"">Taryn Imwalle</cite><span class=""pullquote__quip"" data-testid=""pullquote-quip""></span></p> <p class="""">After more than three years of texting, calling and lots of ""Animal Crossing"" trading, the two were finally able to meet in person in 2023 when Imwalle flew out to attend Czyzewicz's wedding in San Diego, California.</p> <p class="""">""It was the craziest thing,"" Czyzewicz says. ""But at the same time, it felt like I have known Taryn for my whole life.""</p> <p class="""">""I just remember like texting her, 'I'm really nervous about meeting you in person,'"" Imwalle says. ""Sav said the same thing and I was like, 'Oh thank God. I'm not alone in my anxiety.' There's a different element to meeting somebody in person versus talking every day over the phone and on the internet.""</p> <p class="""">The two friends weren't the only ones questioning their plan to make the switch from online to IRL relationship ... at a <em>wedding</em>. Czyzewicz says her mom was convinced Imwalle wouldn't show up, but after they met and hit it off at the wedding she quickly invited Imwalle back to California.</p> <p class="""">Czyzewicz's and Imwalle's partners weren't sold on the idea either. But Czyzewicz pointed out her husband also had an online friend at the wedding, and Imwalle says she and her husband first met online — so how different was it?</p> <p class="""">""It's funny because I never thought anything of it,"" Czyzewicz says. ""Because all my husband's friends don't live in the same state anymore. So that's all they do, is talk online. To me it wasn't anything weird but to a lot of people that's so weird. It's not normal and not something that most people do. But the internet just has has a way about itself.""</p> <p class="""">""Animal Crossing"" as a means for bringing people together makes sense, they say. The game is built around forming new relationships — whether stuck inside or not.</p> <p class="""">“It’s also the nature of the game, because the game is about building relationships and it’s about developing a space in which your character coexists with these animals,” Imwalle says. “And so it’s about friendship, and the community reflects that too.”</p> <p class="""">As the two friends have since been re-employed following lockdown, they have had less time to spend on ""Animal Crossing."" Still, they speak virtually almost every day.</p> <p class=""endmark"">""I had the connection with you that I have with my closest friends, because you are one of my closest friends now,"" Imwalle says. ""Just that feeling when you meet that you have known them for a long time. It's just an instant, almost karmic connection. It's this feeling like you have known them your whole life.""</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Kristian is an editorial intern for TODAY.com.</p> <p>© 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>"

Yes, we're <a href=""https://www.today.com/life/astrology/aries-traits-personality-rcna22002"" target=""_blank"">talking about Aries</a> and <a href=""https://www.today.com/life/astrology/libra-traits-personality-rcna48518"" target=""_blank"">Libra compatibility</a>. </p> <p class="""">Libra and Aries sit opposite each other in the zodiac wheel, which means they're likely to gravitate toward each other. Often called “sister signs,” the juxtaposing energy allows each sign to see what’s missing from their own vibe and fill in the missing pieces. But that's not the whole story.</p> <p class="""">Below, we break down how how the <a href=""https://www.today.com/life/astrology/fire-signs-rcna105108"" target=""_blank"">fire</a> and air sign mesh in areas of love, friendship and more.</p> <p class=""""><strong>Dates:</strong> March 21 to April 19</p> <p class=""""><strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p> <p class=""""><strong>Modality:</strong> Cardinal </p> <p class=""""><strong>Planetary ruler:</strong> Mars </p> <p class=""""><strong>Symbol:</strong> The Ram</p> <p class=""""><strong>Famous Aries:</strong> Mariah Carey, Kourtney Kardashian Barker, Elton John, Lady Gaga, Reese Witherspoon, Randall Park, Jessica Chastain, Sarah Jessica Parker, Diana Ross, Halle Bailey, Chloé Zhao, Pedro Pascal, Eddie Murphy, Pharrell, Lil Nas X</p> <p class=""""><strong>Dates:</strong> Sept. 23 to Oct. 22</p> <p class=""""><strong>Element:</strong> Air</p> <p class=""""><strong>Modality:</strong> Cardinal </p> <p class=""""><strong>Planetary ruler:</strong> Venus</p> <p class=""""><strong>Symbol: </strong>The Scales </p> <p class=""""><strong>Famous Libras:</strong> Kim Kardashian, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Naomi Osaka, Bella Hadid, Serena Williams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cardi B, Doja Cat, Jenna Ortega, Bruno Mars, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Duff, Donald Glover, Kelly Ripa</p> <p class="""">Aries is first sign of the zodiac — and ideally, the first in everything else. Aries tend to act out their emotions on a whim without thinking of the repercussions. While this attribute makes them seem passionate, it can create conflict with others if they’re not careful. Aries want things on their terms and timelines, meaning they enjoy doing the work of forming relationships. As long as they can see beyond their needs and desires, they can create meaningful partnerships.</p> <p class="""">Libras are known for their calm and peaceful demeanors, which means this air sign often remains calm. This sign often finds themselves in long-term relationships. They choose to work through issues and use differences as catalysts to grow. Libras use their significant others, friends and colleagues as lighthouses, helping them navigate their days. Libras will become experts in their loved ones, making them feel special and heard.</p> <p class="""">Libra and Aries are both cardinal signs, meaning they're initiators of seasons (Libra brings autumn and Aries officiates spring). Translated to personality, these signs are prone to jumping into situations quickly, using their energy to get the ball rolling with enthusiasm. They are opposite signs, so they need each other to evoke the different elements of their personality and to grow.</p> <p class="""">When it comes to friendship, both zodiac signs can inspire and motivate the other in different ways. Aries urges Libra to make moves, while Libra convinces Aries to slow down and smell the roses. While they won't see eye-to-eye on all matters, Libra and Aries will help the other compromise, which is more important. Aries isn't one to dwell in an argument. They'll move forward with an understanding of each other — and how to solve problems. </p> <p class="""">If Aries takes a step back and allows Libra to take the lead, then they’ll be able to find ways to allow each other’s efforts in making the partnership shine. It might be hard at first for Aries to let go of control and to have someone lavish them with gifts and attention, but they’ll eventually feel lucky to be the recipient of Libra’s charm and generosity. </p> <p class="""">These two cardinal signs want to make any situation work — to do so, they'll need to choose healthy ways to express themselves in long-term commitments instead of arguing. At times Aries reacts before having all the facts. Libra opts to be more rational and methodical in their reasoning and thoughts. As long as Aries can hone in their impulsivity, these two zodiac signs will be able to communicate effectively and have a great marriage. </p> <p class="""">Aries and Libra have different motivations: Libra tends to play by the rules, Aries values winning above all. If Libra lets Aries be the face of the team or company, then the two will forge a long-lasting relationship. They should be clear about the roles they want to occupy. Libra will offer support to Aries’ dreams and enjoy being along for the ride, while Aries will come to Libra for advice and use them as a sounding board for projects.</p> <p class="""">Bonnie Parker (Libra) and Clyde Barrow (Aries)</p> <p class="""">Kelly Ripa (Libra) and Mark Consuelos (Aries)</p> <p class="""">Marion Cotillard (Libra) and Guillaume Canet (Aries)</p> <p class="""">Alicia Vikander (Libra) and Michael Fassbender (Aries)</p> <p class="""">Neve Campbell (Libra) and JJ Feild (Aries)</p> <p class=""endmark"">Breaux Greer (Libra) and Katy Mixon (Aries) </p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Lisa Stardust is a New York City-based astrologer.

Season Six is set in the late-'90s and covers perhaps one of the modern monarchy's most devastating moments:<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/the-crown-season-6-rcna52886"" target=""_blank""> Princess Diana's death</a>.</p> <p class="""">From Queen Elizabeth II to Prince Harry and everyone in between, TODAY is breaking down a list of which royals, past and present, are rumored to have watched ""The Crown.""</p> <p class="""">The late monarch never made it a habit to comment on <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/the-crown-season-5-trailer-rcna53162?"" target=""_blank"">""The Crown,"" </a>so the jury is still out on whether or not she ever saw the show. Naturally, that means that everyone has their own opinion on the matter. </p> <p class="""">“I heard the queen had watched it, and she used to watch it on a projector on Sunday night, apparently,” said Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip in the first two seasons of the Netflix show,<a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/popculture/prince-harry-called-crown-star-matt-smith-granddad-philip-portrayal-rcna47871"" target=""_blank"">  echoed during an appearance on TODAY</a>.</p> <p class="""">Smith also weighed in on whether or not his character’s namesake ever watched “The Crown.”</p> <p class="""">“A friend of mine sat next to (Philip) at a dinner once … and my friend couldn’t resist by the end of the meal. He was like, ‘Philip, I have to ask, have you watched ‘The Crown?’’” Smith said. “And apparently (Philip) turned around to him and said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous.’”</p> <p class="""">Speaking to <a href=""https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/camilla-dominic-west-the-crown-newsupdate/"" target=""_blank"">Radio Times</a>, West recalled a funny encounter with Camilla, the queen consort. She greeted him as “Your Majesty” at an event in 2021, after he was <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/dominic-west-the-crown-prince-charles-rcna54357"" target=""_blank"">cast as Prince Charles in Seasons Five and Six</a>. She didn't say that she <em>watches </em>""The Crown,"" necessarily — but she is aware.  </p> <p class="""">The love story behind Prince William and Kate, Princess of Wales, begins to play out in Season 6, but do the<a href=""https://www.today.com/news/news/prince-william-kate-middleton-prince-princess-wales-diana-title-rcna47062"" target=""_blank""> Prince and Princess of Wales</a> plan to tune in?</p> <p class="""">In 2019, the heir to the throne told actor Olivia Colman, who previously played Queen Elizabeth II on ""The Crown,"" that he doesn't watch the show.</p> <p class="""">“He asked what I was doing at the moment before he quickly added, ‘Actually, I know what you’re doing,’"" Colman recalled William saying during an appearance on ""The Graham Norton Show,"" <a href=""https://people.com/royals/olivia-colman-had-an-awkward-exchange-with-prince-william-when-she-asked-if-he-watches-the-crown/"" target=""_blank"">as reported by People</a>. “I was so excited and asked, ‘Have you watched it?’ “His answer was a firm, ‘No.’ But he was very charming and very lovely.”</p> <p class="""">In 2021, Prince Harry told ""The Late Late Show"" host <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/prince-harry-reveals-actor-he-d-want-play-him-crown-t210140"" target=""_blank"">James Corden that he has watched ""The Crown</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/prince-harry-reveals-actor-he-d-want-play-him-crown-t210140"" target=""_blank"">.</a><a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/prince-harry-reveals-actor-he-d-want-play-him-crown-t210140"" target=""_blank"">""</a></p> <p class="""">“They don’t pretend to be news. It’s fictional, but it’s loosely based on the truth,” he said during an interview, adding that the show isn't entirely accurate. </p> <p class="""">“But it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle — the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else — what can come from that.”</p> <p class="""">Harry said he appreciates ""The Crown's"" coverage over that of tabloids.</p> <p class="""">“I’m way more comfortable with 'The Crown' than I am seeing the stories written about my family or my wife or myself,"" he explained. ""Because it’s the difference between that is obvious fiction, take it how you will, but this is being reported on as fact because you’re supposedly news. I have a real issue with that.”</p> <p class="""">During the couple's <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/oprah-winfrey-interview-meghan-harry-story-about-archie-s-skin-t216272"" target=""_blank"">interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021</a>, Harry said they both have seen the show, when asked by Oprah: “I’ve watched some of it; we’ve watched some of it,” Harry said.</p> <p class="""">On TODAY, Matt Smith — who played Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/-the-crown-stars-claire-foy-and-matt-smith-open-up-about-season-2-1109798979764"" target=""_blank"">the first two seasons</a> of the hit Netflix drama — had further proof that Harry watches the show.</p> <p class="""">At a polo match, he said Harry approached him with a reference to ""The Crown."" Smith said, “He rocked up to me and he went, ‘Granddad.'""</p> <p class="""">Fast-forward to a January 2023 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and Harry once again admitted to watching the show. </p> <p class="""">The conversation began when Colbert asked Harry what home life is like with the former Meghan Markle and if they like to binge watch TV together — which is when the TV host asked if Harry watches ""The Crown."" </p> <p class="""">“You’ve got to have watched some of ‘The Crown,’ right?” he said.</p> <p class="""">As the crowd laughed over the question, Harry grinned and offered the following response. </p> <p class="""">“People love it. Yes, I have actually watched ‘The Crown,’” he said, adding that he has watched both the “older stuff and the more recent stuff.”</p> <p class="""">Colbert then asked if Harry fact-checks the episodes while watching the show, and the 39-year-old was thoroughly amused by the question. He made a gesture that looked like he was taking notes and said, “Yes I do, actually.”</p> <p class="""">Harry concluded his answer by saying, ""By the way, (that's) another reason why it's so important that history has it right.""</p> <p class="""">Princess Eugenie, the daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, briefly spoke about ""The Crown"" in 2017 at a China Exchange event in London.</p> <p class="""">“I did watch a couple of episodes of 'The Crown.' It is filmed beautifully. The music is wonderful, the story is beautiful,"" she said at the time, per <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a9882247/princess-eugenie-denies-claims-shes-lazy-to-insist-she-works-really-hard/"" target=""_blank"">Town &amp; Country</a>.</p> <p class="""">The princess, now 33, said she felt ""proud"" while watching the show.</p> <p class="""">""I can’t speak for everyone but that’s how I felt when I watched it,” she added.</p> <p class="""">Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's ex-wife, has spoken candidly about her interest in ""The Crown."" <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a37106023/the-crown-sarah-ferguson-offered-character-input-executive-producer/"" target=""_blank"">In a 2021 interview with Town &amp; Country,</a><strong> </strong>Ferguson suggested that the show needs to cover her story a little bit more. “Hello? Where is Fergie?” she joked at the time. </p> <p class="""">Ferguson is still a fan of the Netflix hit, even if she wants more screen time. “I thought it was filmed beautifully. The cinematography was excellent,” she <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sarah-ferguson-reacts-to-her-wedding-being-featured-in-the-crown/"" target=""_blank"">told Us Weekly</a> in 2021. “I loved the way they put my wedding in as well.”</p> <p class="""">Queen Elizabeth II's granddaughter Zara is married to <a href=""https://www.today.com/parents/queen-elizabeth-s-granddaughter-zara-tindall-gives-birth-baby-no-t210867?"" target=""_blank"">Mike Tindall</a> and the <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/popculture/queen-elizabeth-great-grandchildren-rcna48349"" target=""_blank"">couple shares three children</a>. In 2021, Tindall revealed that he was following ""The Crown,"" <a href=""https://people.com/royals/mike-tindall-admits-watching-the-crown/"" target=""_blank"">as reported by People. </a></p> <p class="""">“I need to catch up,” he said during a podcast. “I actually saw the advert for it and I was like, ‘Ooh, I need to catch up.’ Because I only got about halfway through Season Three, so I started watching Season Three last night and then I’ll catch up. But I’ve seen it all over the place this morning on these popular midday TV shows.”</p> <p class="""">The former rugby player acknowledged that many people are ""fascinated"" by the royal family and said he was curious to see how the show would evolve. </p> <p class="""">“It’s getting to more things that people know about, isn’t it? And  (things that people) have opinions about, so that’s where it gets difficult,” he said. ""But remember everyone, it is a drama, so it’s going to be made to be a bit of a drama.”</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">Chrissy Callahan covers a range of topics for TODAY.com, including fashion, beauty, pop culture and food.

In a year where so many are in need we are hoping to make a difference and help support kids and families in need. This is our 30th Toy Drive so let’s make it the best year yet.</p> <p class="""">On the plaza, we will be collecting toys from Tuesday, Nov. 28 through Friday, Dec 22.</p> <p class="""">But don’t worry, if you don’t live nearby or aren’t coming to the area, you can still help this holiday season online!</p> <p class="""">Here’s how to donate to Foster Love, Cradles to Crayons or Ronald McDonald House Charities.</p> <p class="""">Foster Love is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of children in foster care. Comprised of young adults and former foster youth, they work to ensure these vulnerable children are not forgotten or neglected. Through collaborations with individuals, companies, and community partners, they help to provide essential resources and educational opportunities for foster youth.</p> <p class="""">Cradles to Crayons works to fight Children’s Clothing Insecurity directly in Chicagoland, Massachusetts, Greater Philadelphia, NYC, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and focuses on raising awareness about this urgent crisis nationally. They supply basic essentials like clothing, shoes, diapers, and school supplies to children who don’t have access to these critical resources.</p> <p class="""">Ronald McDonald House Charities ensured families everywhere have access to the care and resources they need — especially when they have a sick child. </p> <p class="""">Chapters host thousands of families each year and strive to make sure each family has access to plenty of toys, books and games for relaxing family time. Also, after long days at hospitals, they depend on the help of the community to make sure our families are well nourished.</p> <p class="""">This beloved TODAY tradition started in back in 1994 with our very own staffers sporting a Santa hat, collecting toys from our loyal TODAY plaza visitors. This simple gesture of giving back to communities and organizations in need evolved into the TODAY Toy Drive Spectacular we know and love today. We have had celebrity “elves” lending a hand with our plaza toy collections and have raised millions of dollars over the span of nearly 3 decades. The donations come, not only from our plaza visitors, but corporate partners, inspired to join us in our endeavor.</p> <p class="""">We are now in the 30th year and are aiming to have the most toy donations we have ever had during the Holiday Season of Giving!</p> <p class="""">If you would like to participate, please bring an unwrapped toy with you when you come to visit us.

The deltoids are comprised of three parts: the anterior, middle and posterior deltoid. These fibers cover the upper arms to provide the round shape we’re accustomed to. But beyond aesthetics, they play a crucial role in various upper-body movements. By targeting and strengthening these muscles, you can reduce the risk of shoulder injuries and improve your overall shoulder stability. This is super important, especially if you are play sports or <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-dumbbell-exercises-rcna17936"" target=""_blank"">do strength training</a> that involves a lot of shoulder movements. </p> <p class="""">Deltoid exercises can <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/posture-exercises-rcna12220"" target=""_blank"">improve posture</a>, enhance upper-body strength and help you achieve that sculpted, athletic look. Having strong deltoids can also help you perform everyday movements with ease, like carrying groceries, lifting up a child or object off of the ground and even making your bed!</p> <p class="""">Here are 12 exercises to target the deltoids, enhancing the mobility and strength of the shoulder and upper body overall, while also improving your physique.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet hips-distance apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Reach your arms toward the floor as you hinge forward at the hips, leaning your torso forward on a diagonal. Fly your arms out to the sides as high as the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and then release down to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions. </p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet hips-distance apart, holding one dumbbell in each hand. Bend the knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips. Pull your abs in. Dangle your arms down and then reach the right arm straight up in front of you until it is aligned with your right ear. Then, reach the left arm back behind you, engaging the left tricep. Think about forming one straight, diagonal line with both arms. Return to the starting position. Alternate, reaching the left arm forward and the right arm back. Continue to alternate for 10 repetitions on each side.</p> <p class="""">Stand with your feet hip-distance apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Raise the dumbbells so that your arms are in a goal-post position at shoulder height with palms facing away from you. This is your starting position. Engaging your core to remain stable through each repetition, <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/how-do-dumbbell-shoulder-press-get-results-today-t227469"" target=""_blank"">push the dumbbells overhead</a>. Slowly return back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions. </p> <p class="""">Stand with feet hip-distance apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Engage your core to maintain stability. With palms facing behind you, extend your arms straight up and out in front of you until you reach shoulder height. Slowly return back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions.</p> <p class="""">Stand with feet hip-distance apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Allow your arms to rest at your sides, palms facing your body. Then, extend your arms straight out to the sides, up and away from your body to about shoulder height. Slowly return back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions. </p> <p class="""">Stand with feet hip-distance apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bring the dumbbells up so that they are level with your ears, bending the elbows and turning both palms in toward each other (facing your head). Extend your arms up above your head until your elbows are no longer bent. Slowly return back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions.</p> <p class="""">With a dumbbell in each hand, allow your arms to hang naturally by your sides. Engage your abdominal muscles and keep your back straight. With palms facing each other, lift the weights up until your arms are extended straight out in front of you at shoulder height. Slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions. </p> <p class="""">Stand with feet hip-distance apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bring the dumbbells to shoulder height, and rotate them outward at a 45-degree angle with your elbows tucked into your sides. Extend your arms up above your head until your elbows are no longer bent.

Allow your arms to fall naturally to your sides. Turn your palms so that they are facing out to the sides at a 45-degree angle. With a slight bend in your elbows, raise your arms up and out at your sides until you reach shoulder height, forming a wide “Y”. Maintain palms facing away from you the whole movement. Slowly lower back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 repetitions. </p> <p class="""">This exercise targets your shoulders and core — and hits a lot of other muscles for full-body engagement! Start in a <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/plank-exercise-rcna24413"" target=""_blank"">full plank</a> on your hands. Engage your core to prevent your hips from swaying as you go about this movement. Slowly lower your left elbow to the floor. Then, lower your right elbow. You should now be in an elbow plank. Next, place your left hand on the mat, then your right hand, to return to a full plank position. Repeat for 10 repetitions.</p> <p class="""">Start in a full plank position with hands on the floor beneath your shoulders. Engage your core and drive your elbows out to the sides as you lower your body toward the floor. Press through your hands to drive back up to plank position. Repeat for 10 positions.</p> <p class="""">Stand with feet hip-distance apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing away from your body. Starting with your right hand, raise your arm up and across your body, engaging your core and keeping your arm straight. Slowly return back to the starting position. Perform with the left arm.

It is given as a once-weekly injection under the skin to help control blood sugar.</p> <p class="""">Tirzepatide was approved for weight loss by the FDA under the brand name <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/zepbound-mounjaro-weight-loss-rcna124406"" target=""_blank"">Zepbound</a> in November 2023.</p> <p class="""">It works by targeting the receptors in the brain for two different hormones, GIP and GLP-1, which the body produces after eating. Activating these receptors can decrease appetite and food intake, as well as help the body manage its insulin production.</p> <p class="""">Semaglutide only targets one hormone, ""so you're essentially getting  more bang for the buck when you take Mounjaro,"" NBC news medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar said in a Nov. 28 segment on TODAY.</p> <p class=""""><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8994606/"" target=""_blank"">Studies</a> have found there’s a “synergistic action” when the body’s receptors for both GIP and GLP-1 are activated, leading to greater weight loss. Some research indicates Mounjaro's results could be similar to those of gastric bypass surgery, Azar noted in 2022 after <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/drug-weight-loss-obesity-rcna32297"" target=""_blank"">a study found the drug led to substantial weight loss</a>.</p> <p class="""">“We need this tool in the toolbox,” Azar said. “It’s so important and so relevant. The majority of Americans are either overweight or obese.”</p> <p class="""">Weight loss can be hard for people with diabetes because of the way their body responds to insulin, so tirzepatide could be “extremely helpful” for patients with Type 2 diabetes who need to slim down, Dr. Shauna Levy, medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/people-diabetes-lost-34-pounds-taking-eli-lilly-drug-company-says-rcna81577"" target=""_blank"">told NBC News</a>.</p> <p class="""">So, will Mounjaro make people forget about Ozempic or Wegovy?</p> <p class="""">“I don’t think so,” Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, tells TODAY.com. He’s a scientific adviser for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy.</p> <p class="""">“Having more medications that are slightly different is a good thing because some people may respond better to one and some may respond better to another,"" he adds.</p> <p class="""">An analysis, presented in October 2023 at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Hamburg, Germany, found that Mounjaro may be more effective than Ozempic for weight loss and blood sugar management. The research hasn't been submitted to a medical journal for publication yet, according to a <a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1002351"" target=""_blank"">news release</a> announcing the results.</p> <p class="""">Researchers analyzed 22 randomized controlled trials that involved 18,472 patients with Type 2 diabetes.

They’re all in a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists and <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-explained-rcna71820"" target=""_blank"">mimic the effects of a hormone</a> the body releases when people eat food.

She was surprised to lose about 60 pounds.</p> <p class="""">“It has changed my life,” Huber told NBC News. “Even though I’m a smaller person now, I feel that I’m more visible in society. It’s been a good thing.”</p> <p class="""">Huber said she’s had side effects such as nausea and constipation. Other common side effects of Mounjaro include diarrhea, vomiting, indigestion and stomach pain, according to Eli Lilly. </p> <p class="""">Serious side effects of the drug include pancreatitis, low blood sugar, serious allergic reactions, kidney problems, vision changes and gallbladder problems, <a href=""https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-achieved-157-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or"" target=""_blank"">the company noted</a> in a news release. </p> <p class="""">The October 2023 research comparing tirzepatide and semaglutide also noted that the highest dose of tirzepatide came with the highest increased risk for nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, compared to the placebo group and those using semaglutide.</p> <p class="""">Huber is also worried she’ll <a href=""https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/s-happens-stop-taking-weight-loss-drug-wegovy-rcna66489"" target=""_blank"">gain the weight back</a> if she stops taking Mounjaro.</p> <p class="""">Dr. Christopher McGowan, an obesity medicine specialist in Cary, North Carolina, who has prescribed Mounjaro off-label for weight loss in the past says weight recurrence is ""near-universal"" after patients stop using the drug. </p> <p class="""">""This is identical to what we see after cessation of Wegovy, Ozempic, or any GLP-1 medication, for that matter,"" McGowan tells TODAY.com.</p> <p class="""">""These medications, while potent and highly effective for the treatment of weight, must be continued indefinitely, or weight recurrence is inevitable.

Semaglutide is also meant to be used in addition to eating less and moving more, according to the FDA.</p> <p class=""byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"">A.
