Days after the news of his death, people are also making last-minute costume homages to Perry — full of baggy sweatpants, monochromatic sweaters, vests and ... bunnies.  Ria Swaynie, 29, who uses they/them pronouns, was devastated by the news. Swaynie first watched ""Friends"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living alone, the ""Friends"" cast became the friends they were lacking. ""It felt like I wasn't alone,"" they tell TODAY.com. Chandler was the character they related to most, in terms of outlook  wardrobe. “I’m definitely the type to make a joke when something bad was happening. He was good about making dark times a little better,” they say. Further, Swaynie says Perry’s   mirrored one she saw in a loved one. That made Perry’s death harder. Given their connection to the character and actor, the idea for a Chandler Halloween costume seemed obvious. ""I hoped it wouldn't be seen as offensive. This is in memory of him,"" they say. ""I felt like celebrating him is the best thing to do right now.""  Swaynie has taken Halloween pop culture-inspired Halloween costumes seriously before. Years earlier, they shaved their head completely to be Uncle Fester.  This costume required much less work — just a trip to the closet. The difference here, they say, is that the costume is healing. ""My way of grieving is to celebrate his life,"" Swaynie says. Like Swaynie, Lexi Gerken of Tennessee has cried multiple times since Perry's death. Unlike Swaynie, this year marks the first time the 21-year-old has dressed up as a pop culture character. ""No character has impacted me this much,"" she says.  The day after she heard of Perry’s death, she decided to make a costume, which was easy enough: ""I only had to buy sweatpants,"" she says. Her costume was taken from the scene the friends play football; Chandler wore a gray sweater and bluebaseball hat.  Dressing up as Chandler has been ""cathartic"" for her, and a way to ""remind people of Matthew Perry and his great role."" She says she hopes the costume also reminds people of what Perry shared about his struggles. While many ""Friends"" fans are donning slacks and sweaters in their quest be Chandler, some costumes pay homage to Chandler's own famous Halloween costume — specifically, his . Melissa of Alberta, Canada, says her 11-year-old daughter — who loves ""Friends"" so much she painted her bedroom door purple —  started crying immediately after hearing the news. Her daughter had a brain surgery on her frontal lobe to mitigate seizures, which makes processing big emotions, like grief, more difficult. Melissa was ""shocked"" by the depth of her response: ""She usually can't deal with those emotions (because of) her surgery.""  At 4 p.m. Monday, the day before Halloween, she decided she wanted to be Chandler's bunny for Halloween — a change from her normal stance of never dressing up for the holiday. That afternoon, they drove to four stores before finding a costume that fit. ""She met up with her friends. They're like, 'Oh, you're a bunny.' She's like, 'No, I'm Chandler,"" she says. Though her young friends aren't fans of the show, off they went trick-or-treating together. ""I feel like it's her way of processing through the emotional and depths, understanding that she's honoring him by being the bunny for Halloween,"" she says.

https://www.today.com/popculture/priscilla-presley-age-met-married-elvis-rcna122843,How old was Priscilla Presley when she met Elvis?,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Sofia Coppola’s new biographical drama “Priscilla” delves into Priscilla Presley's   — including how the two met when Priscilla was just 14 years old.  At the time, Elvis Presley, 24, was serving in the Army in Germany, where Priscilla Presley's stepfather was stationed.  Their story has been the subject of countless analyses over the years, with Coppola's work the latest in a long list of retellings. Cailee Spaeny stars in the title role and Jacob Elordi plays Elvis Presley. The real Priscilla Presley, now 78, said   that it was ""difficult"" for her to watch.  “It’s very difficult to sit and watch a film about you, about your life, about your love,” Priscilla Presley said at the time. “Sofia did an amazing job. She did her homework, we spoke a couple of times and I really put everything out for her that I could.” She also insisted that the late King of Rock ’n’ Roll did not take  advantage of her as a young woman. “It was very difficult for my parents to understand that Elvis would be so interested in me and why,” she said, according to Variety. “And I really do think because I was more of a listener. Elvis would pour his heart out to me in every way in Germany: his fears, his hopes, the loss of his mother — which he never, ever got over. And I was the person who really, really sat there to listen and to comfort him. That was really our connection. Even though I was 14, I was actually a little bit older in life — not in numbers. That was the attraction. People think, ‘Oh, it was sex.’ No, it wasn’t. I never had sex with him. He was very kind, very soft, very loving, but he also respected the fact I was only 14 years old. We were more in line in thought, and that was our relationship.” When did Priscilla Presley meet Elvis Presley? Priscilla and Elvis Presley met in 1959, she said in her 1985 book “Elvis and Me.” She said her stepfather, who was in the Air Force, was transferred to a base there, where Elvis Presley was serving in the Army.  At the time, Elvis Presley had been drafted into the service in 1957 and served overseas in Germany from Oct. 1, 1958 to March 2, 1960, according to the  . He'd rocketed to stardom only one year before being drafted with his January 1956 hit ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and subsequent album ""Love Me Tender,"" which was released that same year in November. In her book, Priscilla Presley wrote that she met Elvis Presley at a party when she was 14 years old. She said she had been at the Eagles Club, where American servicemen and their families often dined, after school one day with her brother when a man named Currie Grant approached her and asked if she liked Elvis Presley. In the book, she recalls laughing and asking ""Who doesn't?"" ""I’m a good friend of his,"" she said Grant told her. ""My wife and I go to his house quite often. How would you like to join us one evening?"" Two weeks later — and after her stepfather had met and checked out Grant's credentials — she found herself in a navy and white sailor dress meeting the King of Rock ’N’ Roll. She wrote that Elvis Presley had asked if she was a junior or senior in high school before she revealed she was just in ninth grade. “Ninth grade,” she recalled him laughing. “Why, you’re just a baby.” Elvis Presley, at the time, was 24. His beloved mother, Gladys Presley, had died soon before their meeting. Priscilla Presley, in her book, said that the singer superstar had been very respectful. On their second meeting, she said he asked her to meet him in his room, which she'd been ""flustered"" by.  ""There’s nothing to be frightened of, honey,"" she recalled him telling her. ""I swear I'll never do anything to harm you ... I’ll treat you just like a sister."" She went on to say that they'd cuddled and talked for hours. At the end of the evening, they shared a kiss.  ""He kissed me goodbye, my first real kiss,"" she wrote. ""I had never experienced such a mixture of affection and desire."" Priscilla Presley went on to say that her parents insisted upon meeting Elvis Presley. He won them over with his ""Southern charm."" She said that when the singer had been pressed as to why he wanted to date their teenage daughter, he'd told her parents the following: “Well, sir, I happen to be very fond of her. She’s a lot more mature than her age and I enjoy her company. It hasn’t been easy for me, being away from home and all. It gets kinda lonely. I guess you might say I need someone to talk to. You don’t have to worry about her, Captain. I’ll take good care of her."" Five months later, after continuing to date while in Germany, Elvis Presley returned to the United States. The night before his departure, Priscilla Presley wrote that she ""begged"" the singer to ""consummate our love."" ""It would have been so easy for him. I was young, vulnerable, desperately in love, and he could have taken complete advantage of me,"" she wrote. ""But he quietly said, “No. Someday we will, Priscilla, but not now. You’re just too young."" Eventually, a young Priscilla Presley made her way back to Memphis, Tennessee, at the request of Elvis Presley. She was initially supposed to live with the singer's grandparents but ended up spending most of her time at Graceland until she just moved in. In her book, Priscilla Presley expressly said that she and Elvis Presley had a sexual relationship but did not have penetrative sex until marriage, when she was 21 years old. “We had a strong connection, much of it sexual. The two of us created some exciting and wild times,” she wrote, careful to emphasize at one point that she did not think the musician was “perverted or in any way harmful.” At the Venice Film Festival press conference in September, she said that their bond had been based on trust, per Variety. ""I didn’t know why he put so much trust in me, but he did. And I never, ever, ever told anyone that I was seeing him, and that was another issue that he loved, is the fact that I never gave him up in any way. I never told anyone at school that I was seeing him,"" she said.  ""So, we built a relationship and then our relationship went on until I left. And it wasn’t because I didn’t love him — he was the love of my life. It was the lifestyle that was so difficult for me, and I think any woman can relate to that,” she said. “But it didn’t mar our relationship, we still remained very close. And of course, we had our daughter, and I made sure that he saw her all the time. It was like we never left each other.""

The “Friends” actor’s cause of death at 54 is still unknown pending a toxicology report and further investigation, authorities said. It could be several weeks before an official conclusion is announced.  No information has been released about how long Perry was in the hot tub on the day he died or whether that contributed in any way to his death on Oct. 28. He played pickleball that morning,  . Perry’s assistant later found him unresponsive in his hot tub, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. A 911 call came in at 4:07 p.m. local time and was treated as a water rescue, Los Angeles Fire Capt. Erik Scott  . The responders found “an adult male unconscious in a stand-alone hot tub. A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” he said. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.” Just a few days before his passing, the actor posted a  , writing in the caption, “Oh, so warm water swirling around makes you feel good?” Hot tub safety in general — and how sitting in hot water for long periods of time can affect the body — has long been the focus of scrutiny. The   began warning almost 45 years ago that using hot tubs at water temperatures above normal body temperature can cause drowsiness, which may lead to unconsciousness and drowning. The risk is “significantly heightened” if people drink alcohol while or before soaking in hot water. Alcohol impacts balance, coordination and reaction time. Certain medications can also increase the risk of drowning in general, especially medications commonly prescribed for depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder because the side effects can be similar to the effects of alcohol, the  . Hot tub water temperatures should never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the CPSC noted, adding that soaking in water above that threshold can raise human body temperature to the point of heat stroke. Another concern is a phenomenon known as “ ,” or fainting after soaking in hot water for a long time. While a person is immersed, blood vessels dilate to try to cool the body and the heart rate falls, a study of the condition noted. When the person suddenly gets out of the hot tub, they can feel lightheaded and faint, potentially leading to drowning. To avoid problems, the authors recommend soaking for less than 15 minutes and sitting on the edge of the hot tub for several minutes before walking away instead of standing up abruptly. People with heart disease should also take precautions because the hot water can be taxing on the heart, the  . “A sudden rise in body temperature creates significant stress on your cardiovascular system,” Dr. Curtis Rimmerman, a cardiologist, warned on the clinic's website. “My best advice is to make sure the water temperature is not too high, to stay hydrated, and if you choose to use a hot tub or sauna ― especially if you are a heart patient ― engage in the activity for only brief periods of time” — no more than five to 10 minutes. Pregnant women should avoid using a hot tub early in pregnancy, especially for long periods of time, the   cautions. The rise in an expectant mother’s core temperature can be harmful for the fetus and has been associated with birth defects in some studies, it adds. Children under 5 should not use hot tubs,  . Most everyone should take precautions around hot tubs, research suggests. One   found more than 81,000 people were treated for hot tub–related injuries in U.S. emergency departments in the 17-year period ending in 2007. Almost three-quarters of the accidents happened at home.  Slips and falls were the most common injuries, but the authors also estimated there were more than 2,000 cases of near-drowning — two-thirds involving children 5 years old or younger. Another   found an average of 335 Americans drown in a bathtub, hot tub or spa per year. Then, there are concerns about bacteria. Hot tubs have been associated with outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, a serious type of lung infection,  . The Pool & Hot Tub Alliance, an industry trade group representing swimming pool, spa and hot tub manufacturers, said it was ""deeply saddened to hear about the sudden passing of Matthew Perry.""  ""While we certainly can’t speculate on the cause of Mr. Perry’s death, we can provide guidance on the safe and proper use of hot tubs,"" Sabeena Hickman, president and CEO of the Pool & Hot Tub Alliance, noted in a statement to TODAY.com. The group recommends the following  : Jacuzzi, the maker of hot tubs,   that people with a heart condition, high blood pressure or other serious medical condition should not enter a spa without a doctor’s approval. Pregnant women should consult their physician on whether it is advisable to use a hot tub, the company adds. A. Pawlowski is a TODAY health reporter focusing on health news and features.

We stay true to what a Frosty is and are careful with the flavors that we develop,” John Li, Wendy’s vice president of culinary innovation, told TODAY.com. “We originally thought this might only work in the summertime, but the reality is it works year-round, which led to the Peppermint Frosty, which we launched last holiday season. There’s some fun stuff that’s happening.” As for how Wendy’s decides on its seasonal Frosty flavors, Li says that out of a culinary team of 15, two employees are dedicated to Frosty fantasizing and fabrication. “You start off with 20 all the way up to like 50 or 60 different versions until you get it whittled down to the top three. That is the typical process,” he says. Meanwhile, around the world,   fill the air: There are Bahamas’ Pina Colada and Kit Kat Frostys, Philippines’ Red Velvet Frosty and the Middle East’s Key Lime Pie Frostys, among others. For years, stateside social media users have been asking for new Frosty flavors, like   or  , to name a couple. When asked about Frosty flavors in development, Li remains tight-lipped, but he did convey that Wendy’s seasonal approach to Frostys has opened up a world of possibilities. “It does make it sort of endless in terms of what we can do with flavors that our fans have either asked for or that we research to understand what works. It’s kind of tricky from that perspective,” Li says, adding that the company has a few ideas in development. “I can’t share a ton, but what I can share is the things that we   launch you’ll think, ‘aha, that makes total sense.’” “Something as simple as a Strawberry Frosty: I think most of our competitors would just throw some strawberry syrup and you mix it in. We can’t do that. It’s just not a part of our makeup,” Li continues. “If we’re going to actually kind of deliver something that we know the fans actually take super seriously, you cannot mess it up, you don’t have second chances.” Washington, D.C. native Joseph Lamour is a lover of food: its past, its present and the science behind it.

Trebek was joined by former TODAY co-anchor Katie Couric, who lost her sister Emily to pancreatic cancer in 2001 and helped Trebek to establish the fund to bolster research efforts.   ""This was something that Alex actually would champion. He loved a good challenge. He was very curious. He loved to know the answers both at ""Jeopardy"" and at home,"" Trebek told Guthrie in an interview aired Nov. 1, 2023. ""I think this really coincides with his character, his spirit of helping others and finding the right answers."" Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach which plays a major role in digestion,  . Pancreatic cancer is rarely found in the earlier stages, when the chance of curing the cancer is the greatest.

Although the early stages are often asymptomatic, as the pancreatic cancer grows it may cause the following symptoms,  : Pancreatic cancer is so deadly because it's usually only caught in the advanced stages, when it has already spread outside of the gland to other parts of the body.  By the time Alex Trebek was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the tumor had already spread to his stomach,  .

""Science takes money and that's why we're establishing this,"" Couric added. Couric discussed exciting areas of research in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. These include the potential use of liquid biopsies — a blood test to detect signs of cancer — and a personalized mRNA pancreatic cancer vaccine which reawakens the immune system to fight cancer cells.

The TV personality didn’t know it then, but she had a tumor growing on her pancreas — a rare type of pancreatic cancer that was finally  . Doctors initially told her she was fine, but she kept pushing for answers to explain symptoms like bloating, diarrhea and the hurting stomach on the plane. “It was like that kind of pain where you felt like you were going to explode inside,” Menounos, 45, recalls to TODAY.com. “I thought it was the farro. I thought that I must be getting really gluten intolerant and my stomach just was not handling this well.” In 2022, she underwent an endoscopy and a colonoscopy to try to figure out her digestive issues, but nothing came up. A CT scan also didn’t find anything, with the results describing her pancreas and other organs as looking “unremarkable,”  . But Menounos kept having symptoms. In November 2022, she remembers being buckled over in pain.  “That’s why I keep saying to people: If the symptoms persist, so should you,” she says. “You have to be your own advocate and you have to keep pushing. It’s exhausting, but your life really depends on it.” In January, she decided to get a full-body MRI from a private company, which revealed she had a 3.9-centimeter mass on her pancreas. A second MRI ordered by her doctor confirmed it. Menounos was later told the CT scan missed the tumor because it didn’t show it as clearly as the MRI.

It helps the body break down food and regulate blood sugar. About 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in exocrine cells,  hich produce the digestive “juices.” This is called pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

The overall five-year survival rate is 53%. Symptoms depend on the type of hormone the cells produce and can include acid reflux, burning abdominal pain or jaundice. “I really encourage anybody who’s having any consistent pain or symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, gas or constipation — you have to look deeper.

The cancer hadn’t spread anywhere and she didn't have to undergo any other treatment. Today, Menounos says she’s doing well and has a great prognosis. She continues to stay vigilant for any symptoms by keeping a health journal on her phone. Menounos simply makes notes of anything she notices — any changes in stool, energy levels or appetite — so that she remembers how long it’s been going on. She’ll get a PET scan every year to monitor for any recurrence.

He was in a really good place, which is why this seems so unfair.” Perry's death at age 54 stunned fans and those in the Hollywood community who are  . Reports surfaced that Perry had been feeling well at the time of his death, even   hours before he died. That just amplified how stunned Kauffman felt. “I was just in utter shock,” she said. “My first impulse was to text him, honestly. And then deep sadness. It’s hard to grasp. You know, one minute he’s here and happy, and then poof. And doing good in the world. Really doing good in the world.” Perry had said that when he died people would be shocked by the news, but not surprised. Crane said he agrees with that sentiment. “I would say that’s probably true,” he said. “Given the journey he’d been on, and we were all aware of it, there was always a part that was kind of bracing for something like this.

And I think when we talk about Matthew, we were all very aware that our priority was supporting him.” Kauffman said she felt Perry was in a good place when they last spoke. “Yes. I did feel that way. I did. He seemed better than I had seen in a while. I was so thrilled to see that. He was emotionally in a good place. He looked good. He quit smoking,” she said, noting that he was sober at that time. Kauffman said he was doing well and had found that his struggles provided something in his life that gave him meaning. “He learned things throughout this, and what he learned more than anything is that he wants to help other addicts. And it gave him purpose,” she said. In one of his last interviews, Perry said he didn’t want “Friends” to be the   about him and that he’d rather be remembered as someone who helped others deal with the types of issues he did. “That doesn’t surprise me that as important as the show was, and continues to be, I think that absolutely became his purpose, his reason for being,” Crane said. Kauffman says that Perry’s death was crushing for her, and for all the people he was able to connect with in his life. “I lost a friend, in multiple ways.

https://www.today.com/life/holidays/heidi-klum-halloween-costumes-rcna118978,See Heidi Klum’s elaborate Halloween costumes over the years,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Heidi Klum is  . The model and TV host has been   — except for a two-year hiatus in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. Part of the annual event's success is due to Klum's elaborate and iconic costumes every year. From appearing unrecognizable as Fiona from ""Shrek"" and a massive worm, to bringing along five ""clones"" of herself, Klum is always dressed to impress for Halloween. And with her yearly elaborate costumes come fans anticipating what she will do next. This year, the model shocked people by dressing as a peacock.  The ""America's Got Talent"" judge arrived in a blue velvet bodysuit, complete with a peacock face mask. She was accompanied by a group of Cirque Du Soleil dancers, wearing peacock feather print bodysuits and posing as her tail feathers.  They made an elaborate and fabulous entrance, posing in an array of poses and lifting Klum up at one point to show off the full peacock look.  Additionally, Klum's look was also a couple's costume. Her husband, musician Tom Kaulitz, dressed up as a giant peacock egg.  “She always comes up with something..first,”  . “So this year she said, ‘Hey I’m a peacock, so what can you do with a peacock to match?’” With her 2023 Halloween party all wrapped for the year, it's time to look back at all of Klum's iconic looks over the last two decades.  Klum showed up to the first of her many Halloween parties in an all-black Dominatrix costume, a more tame look compared to future years. Her second annual party was where Klum's elaborate setups began. She rode into the event on a real horse to complete her Lady Godiva costume. Klum dipped her toes into the world of animated characters for her 2002 party when she dressed up as flapper caricature Betty Boop.  Leaning towards the abstract, Klum went for a gold extraterrestrial or divine being of unknown origin in 2003. Klum delved into witchcraft in 2004, wearing a bright red outfit and an even brighter red hair with skeleton bones sticking out. In 2005, Klum showed up as a vampire, batwings and all, with an intricate heart design pinned to her top.  In 2006, the model showing up to her annual Halloween party as the forbidden fruit from the biblical story of Adam and Eve.  With the polarizing reception of the 2019 CGI-heavy ""Cats"" movie, fans might look back on Klum's 2007 feline bodysuit differently.  In 2008, Klum attended her Halloween party as the Hindu goddess Kali.   that she received backlash for posing as the sacred figure.  A crow won't forget your face, and we won't forget Klum and then-husband Seal's 2009 costumes as the spooky birds. Robot? Purple alien? Klum used stilts to make her 2010 extravagant creation even more intimidating. Klum had two parties in 2011. For one party, she dressed as a skinless person with every fiber and muscle on display.  For the other 2011 Halloween bash, she and Seal showed up in intricate ape costumes. Klum decided to upgrade a classic costume with shiny details when she dressed up as Cleopatra for her 2012 party. She bedazzled her face in jewels, emphasizing the Egyptian queen's decadence. In 2013, Klum transformed into an older adult with full body makeup.  Klum hatched into a colorful — and slightly terrifying — butterfly for 2014. Klum went above and beyond to look like Jessica Rabbit from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" in 2015.  Even when Klum isn't transforming into another character, she still knows how to execute an impressive costume. In 2016, she dressed five others to look exactly look her. In 2017, Klum thrilled the streets of New York City when she dressed up as the werewolf from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" music video. She even brought an entourage of horrifying zombies with her. In 2018, Klum dressed up as Fiona from ""Shrek,"" taking on the ogre princess' red hair and standing alongside now-husband Tom Kaulitz dressed as an equally impressive Shrek. In 2019, Klum was an alien creature who appeared to have been tested on with metal tubes and staples all over her costume. 2020 was the first year in two decades that Klum was unable to host a party, but she was still able to go above and beyond from home.  Klum posted a short film that shows her and her family having Halloween at home. However, things go downhill when she wrapped her kids and husband in toilet paper, resulting in them turning into actual horrific mummies. They chase Klum around the spooky house and she tries to get away from them as best she can, from hiding in knights armor to disguising herself in full body paint that gives off Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used To Know” music video vibes.  After another year of having to result to filmmaking, Klum decided to continue 2020's story with a sequel shared on Instagram. The production begins with showing Klum and her husband's graves, hinting that they both died from the events of last Halloween. She then rises from the grave and surprises her kids. However, she has a hard time getting her life back together, as her ear falls off when putting an earring on and her body continues to degrade. And last, but definitely not least, is her 2022 costume. Klum made a Halloween comeback by not reaching for the stars, but reaching into the dirt. She transformed into a worm that was being hooked by Kaulitz, who was dressed as a fisherman with one eye falling out. If there’s one thing to learn from Klum’s decades-long history with iconic Halloween costumes, it’s that you’ll never know what she'll do next — but you can count on it being memorable.

https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/starbucks-red-cups-2023-rcna122524,Starbucks’ new red cups are here: See the designs and full holiday menu,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Now that everyone has been sufficiently tricked and treated, Starbucks is officially welcoming the holiday season with a slew of new and returning items. Like  ’, the coffee giant announced the return of its holiday menu — plus, it unveiled its much-anticipated red cup designs. Starting Nov. 2, Starbucks’ seasonal suite of beverages, food and more will be officially back at stores across the country. Here’s everything coming down the Pike (Place) at Starbucks this season, from   and bites to holiday cup designs — and more. This year’s collection of holiday cups take the traditional red and green color scheme and adds in an interesting accent hue to the mix. The four warm beverage cups in the collection feature Starbucks greens, holiday reds and magenta, which the chain calls “mood-boosting,” as well as sparkles.  “We found that magenta alongside the holiday reds and greens lifts the traditional holiday colors and makes the red look even brighter,” said Kristy Cameron, creative director at Starbucks, in a press release. “This year’s holiday theme is ‘Share the Joy,’” she added. “It’s our shared human experience and togetherness that makes the season special.” The idea for the Party Plaid cup was inspired by a warm woolen winter plaid. “I was thinking about a classic plaid scarf, but I wanted it to feel a bit more modern,” said Starbucks lead art director Bridget Shilling, who designed all the cups this season, in a press release. “So, I played with an unexpected palette and added geometric sensibility for elevated flair.” Starbucks’ Peppermint Mocha was the inspiration for this design.  “This illusory cup design is inspired by sensorial movement and evokes the familiarity of tissue paper and the swirling shapes of peppermint candies,” Shilling said. “I wanted it to feel inviting for customers to pick it up, spin it around and watch the design come to life.” This design features a cup wrapped in colorful ribbons.  “I wanted it to feel joyful and a bit imperfect, similar to how you might store your ribbons for holiday wrapping,” Shilling said. Shilling’s favorite design features ornament shapes that create a bold, mod print, wrapped around the cup at an angle, as a play on gift-wrap. “There’s a subtle tilt to the pattern that plays well with our tapered cup shape and brings to mind a uniquely wrapped gift,” Shilling said. Starbucks’ new holiday cold cup features playful bauble designs with sparkles in a “snowy white.” Starbucks is welcoming back four of its most anticipated holiday drinks, as well as introducing a one to the roster. Additionally, select locations in the U.S. that serve the   will offer a new Oleato beverage. The new drinks include: This brand-new beverage features notes of warm gingerbread, a blend of chai spices and oat milk to create what the chain calls a “cold holiday beverage that is perfectly balanced by the comforting flavors of the season.” It’s available both iced and hot.  “It’s a love letter to gingerbread and ginger,” said Mat Thornton, senior beverage developer at Starbucks, in a press release. “The gingerbread flavor amplifies the spice of the chai.” First introduced more than two decades ago, this minty and chocolaty Starbucks drink is back again. Starbucks’ signature Espresso Roast is paired with steamed milk, mocha sauce and peppermint-flavored syrup.  The beverage is then finished with a topping of whipped cream and dark chocolate curls. It’s available hot, iced and as a Frappuccino blended beverage. The Caramel Brulée Latte features Starbucks Espresso Roast, steamed milk and a caramel brulée sauce. The drink is then topped with whipped cream and caramel brulée bits and is available either hot, iced or as a Frappuccino blended beverage. The Chestnut Praline Latte comes with signature Espresso Roast, steamed milk and features flavors of caramelized chestnuts and spices. The latte is finished with a topping of whipped cream and spiced praline crumbs and is available hot, iced or as a Frappuccino blended beverage. Back for its third holiday season is the Iced Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte, which is made with sugar cookie-flavored syrup, Starbucks Blonde Espresso, ice and almond milk. Available hot, iced and as a Frappuccino blended beverage, this drink is finished with a festive topping of red and green sprinkles.

The chain’s take on a classic gingerbread recipe is a baked loaf complete with ginger-spice flavors. This treat also happens to be  , Starbucks says. This bite consists of a peppermint chocolate cake with white-chocolaty frosting and crumbly pieces of candy cane. This one features a blondie cake with dried cranberries and a layer of cream cheese icing with orange zest and more dried cranberries sprinkled on top. This buttery, snowman-shaped shortbread is dressed up in white-chocolaty icing and adorably decorated as if his ears are cold with touches of blue icing. Visions of sugar plums may dance in your head, but now sugar plums can accompany your latte, too. This treat features a Danish filled with cream-cheese and is topped with a spiced sugar plum spread. Starbucks Reserve Roasteries in New York, Chicago or Seattle can try a smorgasbord of seasonal baked goods exclusive to its locations which include a Princi Chocolate Hazelnut Swirl Cake, Pistachio Maritozzo, Apple Crumb Pie and Cranberry Cheese Danish. Back in October,   which includes items like a glitzy-looking Geometric Rainbow Glass Mug, Poinsettia Red Prism Cold Cups with a matching Poinsettia Red Prism Ornament, a set of six Color Changing Hot Cups and more.

We'll routinely update this list, so be sure to check back once you've watched everything. Ares and Raquel are a young couple in Stockholm who finally reunite on a beach trip after a year of maintaining a long-distance relationship. With new characters in their friend groups and lives, they face the question of whether their love will truly withstand all tests. This recent take on Jane Austen's classic romance novel ""Persuasion"" features Dakota Johnson as Anne Elliot, who reunites with her ex-lover after eight years of separation and experiences a second chance at love in 19th-century England. Rom-com royalty   star as Peter Coleman and Debbie Dunn in ""Your Place Or Mine."" Peter and Debbie had a one-night stand 20 years ago and became best friends thereafter. They were never really honest about their feelings, and literally have to move into each other's houses before coming clean. ""The Princess Switch"" puts a Christmas spin on Mark Twain‘s 1881 novel ""The Prince and the Pauper."" Vanessa Hudgens plays two women from different worlds who bump into each other and immediately recognize their striking, albeit identical, resemblance. They agree to temporarily switch places, but things get complicated when they each fall in love with someone from the life they're pretending to live.  Jenna Jones (played by Gabrielle Union) needs someone to give her a second chance. And she gets it. But shortly after starting her new gig as a fashion editor, she starts falling for a younger guy — whom she later learns is one of her co-workers and not to mention, her boss's son. Is she willing to risk her job for love? Only Jenna knows the answer. Here's a ""Romeo & Juliet"" love story — with a happy ending. Jade Butterfield (played by Gabriella Wilde) comes from money and privilege, while David Elliot (played by Alex Pettyfer) certainly doesn't. They meet and fall in love just the same. Their families canonically disapprove, but eventually resort to unlikely alliances that help them bond for real. Sloane (played by Emma Roberts) and Jackson (played by Luke Bracey) meet while returning their respective holiday gifts. They bond over a shared dislike of the holidays due to their families giving them grief for not being in a relationship. So, they agree to spend the holidays together so their families will lay off. It works — in more ways than one.  What happens when two people want to be together but everything else seems to get in the way of their love? That's the story for Danny (played by Michael Ealy) and Debbie (played by Joy Bryant) in ""About Last Night."" They meet and immediately want a relationship, even moving in together three months after meeting. But then they break up and have to find their way back to each other through all the noise. There's love. And then there's  love, an unfiltered commitment to someone's needs even if they don't include you. ""Really Love"" shows this type of love in action as the character Isaiah (played by Kofi Siriboe) becomes resigned to losing Stevie so he can experience more joy. Noni (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is supposed to sing. Kaz (played by Nate Parker) is supposed to protect. The problem: Noni veers from that agreement after feeling some enormous pressure, and, as a result, Kaz comes to her rescue. They love each other from there on out, much to the dismay of, well, everyone. ""La La Land"" is all giggles and jubilee until Seb (played by Ryan Gosling) and Mia (played by Emma Stone) snap back to reality. Seb and Mia love each other, but their conflicting careers force them to pick their professional passions or each other.  Goodbye hair, hello ""Nappily Ever After."" Violet (Sanaa Lathan) and her boyfriend split in the wake of her hair loss. This experience prompts her to cut her remaining hair and to live the life she actually wants to live, not the one her mother has forced her to all these years.

https://www.today.com/popculture/matt-rife-apology-natural-selection-netflix-controversy-rcna126135,Why Matt Rife’s Netflix comedy special — and his apology — is stirring controversy,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands , and the backlash for his opening sequence — that included a joke he said is about domestic violence — has been swift. Rife, whose crowd work videos have gone viral on TikTok and catapulted him into the comedy mainstream, responded to his critics on Monday, Nov. 20, on his Instagram story, ensnaring him in further controversy. ""If you've ever been offended by a joke I've told- here is a link to my official apology,"" Rife wrote, also including a link labeled ""Tap to resolve your issue."" The link directed users to a website selling products described as ""special needs helmets"" for children and adults. Social media users panned his response, with  : ""Oh good. Ableism to chase the misogyny."" ""Matt Rife posts a link to an 'apology' but it’s really just this……BIG YIKES,"" another  . Representatives for Rife did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment from TODAY.com. Here's what to know about Rife and the controversy surrounding his Netflix special, ""Natural Selection."" Rife, who has amassed more than 18 million followers on TikTok since starting to post his crowd interactions on the app last summer, went from self-producing and crowd-funding his own comedy specials to releasing ""Natural Selection"" on Netflix on Nov. 15.  The 28-year-old started his special, filmed in Washington, D.C., by calling nearby Maryland ""so beautiful and so ratchet"" and describing a time when he saw a hostess at a Baltimore restaurant with a black eye. ""A full black eye. It wasn’t like, 'What happened?' It was pretty obvious what happened,"" Rife said. ""But we couldn’t get over, like, this is the face of the company? This is who you have greeting people? ""And my boy, who I was with, was like, 'Yeah, I feel bad for her, man. I feel like they should put her in the kitchen or something where nobody has to see her face.' And I was like, 'Yeah, but I feel like if she could cook, she wouldn’t have that black eye.'"" After receiving mixed reactions from the live audience, Rife said: ""Testing the water, seeing if y’all are going to be fun or not. Just wanted to see. I figured we start the show with domestic violence, the rest of the show should be pretty smooth sailing after that."" Rife then went on to say she should have been carrying ""protection crystals,"" before making jokes about what he called ""crystal girls"" and women who blame astrology on their ""poor decision-making skills."" Rife also caught heat before his Netflix special premiered, when   on Nov. 14 one of the biggest misconceptions about him online is that he only has a female fan base, and that he thought his new special catered to men. “One thing I wanted to tackle in this special was showing people that, despite what you think about me online, I don’t pander my career to women,” he said. “I would argue this special is way more for guys.” He added: “I wanted to make this special for everybody. I pride myself on making my comedy for everybody. It’s not for a specific demographic.” Users on X were quick to call his joke in ""Natural Selection"" and his subsequent apology   among other terms. ""Matt Rife: my special is for guys... Immediately opens up with a domestic violence joke,""  . ""Matt Rife opens his special with a 'if a woman could cook she wouldn’t have a black eye' joke,""  .

Well then, assuming you haven't seen my other two full hour specials before, here's a third one with no crowd work in it,'"" he said. ""We just fit (crowd work) in for fun in the credits.

https://www.today.com/health/jill-martin-ends-chemo-treatment-rcna126201,Jill Martin reflects on her chemo journey with gratitude after ‘ringing the bell’,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Thanksgiving is a day for gratitude — and today, Jill Martin Brooks has an abundance of it. Recently, the TODAY contributor rang the chemo bell, successfully closing a chapter in her breast cancer journey. After being diagnosed with  earlier this year, Jill underwent a   and had 17 lymph nodes removed before starting aggressive chemotherapy. After finishing radiation, she’ll have surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes to reduce her risk for ovarian cancer.  Today, she’s giving thanks for how far she's come. “I’m grateful that my body has allowed me to get through this. Cancer wants to take whatever you have — it wants to take your friendships, it wants to take your job, it wants to take your health, it wants to take your hair, it wants to take your family … it wants to take everything. And so you just have to sort of fight where you can, and keep what’s important to you,” she says. She’s even thanking chemotherapy. “You have to take happy moments and celebrate them when you get them. Part of my journey this Thanksgiving is thanking chemo for helping me beat this disease.” Jill sat down with TODAY.com to talk about what she’s learned from going through chemo — and the coping strategies she used to persevere.  Jill says that for many, ringing the bell at the end of chemo is a declaration of “OK, it’s over."" But she reminds herself that  journey is just beginning. “I mean, I still have radiation, I still have another surgery, but the chemo … it’s tough. The ringing of the bell is a step.” More than anything, it’s a symbol of hope and perseverance for Jill. “It’s symbolic of my ability to fight. It’s symbolic of everyone else out there who is fighting and has a milestone to celebrate,” she says.  Like many journeys in life, Jill looked at chemotherapy as something that has a typical beginning, middle and end. “But cancer doesn’t work like that,” Jill explains. “You have to know that cancer is so powerful and insidious. You can’t work on beating it — you have to work on strategically   with it.” Jill says that while creating a narrative about her treatment has helped her make sense of — and even make friends with  — chemo, it hasn't been easy.  “I mean, they walk in in a full hazmat suit … and it’s literally a huge red needle,” Jill says with a laugh.  She opted for one of the most aggressive forms of chemotherapy, what’s dubbed the “red devil” by cancer patients. But Jill says something she initially dreaded has become an unlikely “best friend” these past few months. She came to think of chemo as someone who would fight for her — and alongside her — to either beat the disease or live with it.  Her advice for people just starting treatment? “Visualize chemo differently, and flip it — saying (to yourself) I need the 'red devil' to fight this disease with me. That perspective helps me, and it calms me and it makes chemo less scary.” When she reflects on how she copes with living with and treating breast cancer, she says it comes down to making a choice between two different paths. Making a decision — like whether to work during treatment —  is a fork in the road, she says. “You can choose the path to lie in bed and cry, which was very easy for me to do. Or I could choose the path that I come to work,” Jill explained. It can be a decision as simple as getting out of bed or going out for a walk. “It’s every day and it is numerous times a day. Try to pick the 'silver linings' road. And also give yourself grace — but not enough grace to fall apart. You have to push yourself, because otherwise cancer will keep you in bed crying,” she says.   Jill says that her chemo journey has started and ended with gratitude — and that sharing her story with TODAY has been a gift because of its power to touch people's lives.  “The amount of people who have gotten checked, who have tested positive or who are now taking preventive measures ... I would do it all over again.” As Jill reflects on chemo treatment, she shares what she would have told herself that first day she sat down with the 'red devil': “Hang in there. You’re going to come out better than you were before.” Margaret O'Malley is an editor at TODAY and NBC News BETTER covering health and wellness, food and personal finance.  © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

""Good Burger"" started as a skit on the '90s Nickelodeon TV show ""All That,"" when the world was first introduced to Ed (Mitchell) and Dex (Thompson), two friends working at a fast-food franchise called, you guessed it, Good Burger.  In the first ""Good Burger"" movie, which came out in July 1997, Ed and Dex were faced with the ultimate dilemma: another fast-food mogul opening across the street and threatening to close their doors. Now, in ""Good Burger 2,"" another threat to their jobs has surfaced — this time, in the form of robotic clones.  Regardless of how much time has passed between now and when ""Good Burger"" sparked its first laughs in the '90s, Thompson and Mitchell have remained friends.  ""It was just so natural, just fun, to work with my brother and just laugh all day,"" Mitchell tells TODAY.com of jumping back into filming as their ""Good Burger"" characters.

Spectators can catch a view of the parade just after it turns at Columbus Circle onto Central Park South but before it switches onto 6th Avenue.  Viewers can get as close as possible to the end of the parade here, but avoid the area on 6th Avenue between West 34th and West 38th Street, where viewing is limited.  If you see Hoda quickly run her finger in front of her mouth like she's signaling to someone they have lipstick on their teeth, that's actually a cute little sign for her daughters Haley, 6, and Hope, 4, watching the parade at home.   Hoda said on TODAY Wednesday that she likes to do a secret sign every year at the parade to let the girls know that ""Momma is looking at them.""

Old fan favorites like Pikachu (above), SpongeBob SquarePants and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" are back, plus seven new balloon characters.  You can't have the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade without a Snoopy balloon, and this year fans will get to see Beagle Scout Snoopy. The other new balloons include Blue Cat & Chugs, “Kung Fu Panda” character Po, Netflix's “Leo” lizard, Monkey D. Luffy, the Pillsbury Doughboy and Illumination's “Migration” character Uncle Dan. Willy Wonka and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be hitting the streets of Manhattan as two of the four new floats that will make their debut in 2023.   The eye-popping pink of the ""Deliciously Delectable World of Wonka"" by Warner Bros. Pictures float is inspired by Willy Wonka’s candy shop and features 500,000 pieces of prop candy. The two-story Ninja Turtles float, inspired by the Paramount Pictures film ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"" stands 28-feet tall and will be folded down to travel through the Lincoln Tunnel before arriving at the parade.

https://www.today.com/parents/teens/teens-volunteer-pallbearers-homeless-military-veterans-rcna124391,'Everybody has worth': High school kids serve as pallbearers for homeless veterans,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands When homeless veterans die without family or friends to claim them, some high school students are helping lay them to rest with honor and respect. “There’s something powerful about seeing a coffin in your school,” Dr. Peter Folan, president of Catholic Memorial college preparatory school, which hosts military funerals, tells TODAY.com. “The American flag right there, and when you see those two current servicemen fold the flag, play taps and then hand that flag to the history teacher who was a Marine — that’s a full circle moment for a kid. We don’t necessarily understand the power of that symbolism. We need that more now than ever.” Folan leads the Boston school's initiative to host the funeral processions of veterans who die without family or friends. The program started in 2017, and since then numerous funerals have taken place in the school's chapel. Services have sometimes been held in the gym in front of the entire 600-person school. “Kids begin to recognize that those are people who have sacrificed much and have displayed incredible courage, duty and honor,” he says. “And now in their final moments, for a whole host of reasons, some of which we don’t know enough about each individual, they are alone — and we’re here to stand with them and bring them into our community. That has a transformational impact on a 15- or 16- year-old young man.” From pallbearers to reading scripture, or simply as mourners paying their respects, students take on several roles during the funerals.  ""When we as a school come together to talk about and bury someone who has died without family and friends, that leads to work informing, forming and then ultimately transforming those students through that experience,"" Folan says. ""That’s really why we’re doing it, is to make those intricate linkages between the head and the heart."" Catholic Memorial is not the only school where students work to make sure veterans are buried with dignity and respect. “It’s really extraordinary to take note of someone who was left to die in the cold on the street,” Richard Mazyck, campus ministry and service coordinator for University of Detroit Jesuit School, tells TODAY.com. “They have no family and friends that anyone is able to contact ... It’s a reminder that every person, especially in the Christian religious tradition, is made in the image of God and is deserving of a particular regard and respect.” Mazyck manages the Pallbearer Ministry at the Michigan high school. The student volunteers take the time out of their school day to help support a ceremony or burial for veterans or others who would otherwise be buried alone. ""We might even very strongly disagree at various times, but everybody has worth and value. Assisting at their funeral, or at their committal and burial, is a way of honoring their lives, even though we may have never met them,"" he says. The Pallbearer Ministry at the school began after six seniors volunteered to help bury three unclaimed veterans in October, 2015. Since then, volunteers have helped carry veterans in ceremonies at Great Lakes National Cemetery and others cemeteries around the Detroit area. ""This was an opportunity to give something to somebody who finished their life on the fringe of society,"" Tom Lennon, a former student,  . ""These veterans were men I had never met, but they helped make the country I live in safer and stronger. No matter who they were or what they did on earth, every person deserves a proper burial."" Sometimes the students carry the coffin, and at other times they act as a team of ""honor guards"" who provide support and pray for the deceased. The program paused from 2019-2021 because of COVID, but has come back stronger than ever. It's really an honor and, in itself, its own consolation to be able to offer some support. The school ministry has partnered with A.J. Desmond & Sons Funeral Home in Troy, Michigan. The county attempts to find relatives to claim the body, but if nobody has responded after 90 days, the veterans are cared for by the funeral home. “The students’ service is quite simply valuable to our firm because that is what we do — we serve our community by caring for and honoring the dead, regardless of financial circumstances,"" John Desmond, the funeral home's director, told TODAY.com in 2015. Caskets are provided by the Dignity Memorial Network's Homeless Veterans Program, which aims to provide homeless and unclaimed veterans with a proper military burial across the country. Mazyck says the volunteers often reflect during and after the service. ""It's great to be with other people and pray with them, encourage them or just be present with them when they're in their sorrow. We all have times and moments of sorrow in our lives, including the passing of loved ones and friends and colleagues,"" Mazyck says. ""So it's really an honor and, in itself, its own consolation to be able to offer some support."" Folan says the program opens his students' hearts and gives them a deeper view on the world. ""When you look beyond in that moment, that helps you to see a larger horizon,"" Folan says. ""And that's going to require us to have a preferential treatment for the poor, to care for those who are marginalized, to welcome people into our community.""  ""And then what does that mean for you as a human being? How are you going to change your outlook?"" Kristian is an editorial intern for TODAY.com. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/health/al-roker-hospitalized-1-year-later-rcna125962,Al Roker reflects 1 year after hospitalization for blood clots: ‘Life can turn on a dime’,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Al Roker is thrilled to be hosting the 2023   after health issues last year caused him to miss the parade for the first time in 27 years. The beloved TODAY weatherman's co-hosts are equally excited about his return. “You know the best part of the parade this year? Guess who’s going to be back!” Co-host Craig Melvin said on TODAY on Nov. 20.  “The parade was not the same last year without Al,” recalled TODAY’s Hoda Kotb, adding that the team is “over the moon” that he is going to be back hosting the parade this year. “I feel pretty good. ... I feel like I’m back to like 100%,” Al tells TODAY.com in a phone interview.  However, this time last year, things looked quite different. In November 2022, Al was   due to   in his legs, which spread to his lungs. As a result, he was unable to host the parade for the first time since 1995. Instead, Al watched the balloons, floats and crowds that morning from a hospital bed — though he was   just in time for Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Shortly after returning home, Al was re-admitted to the hospital in late November due to internal bleeding, which caused him to miss the annual lighting of the  . After the parade, ""(I thought), certainly, I'll be ready for the tree lighting ... and I watched them both from the hospital,"" says Al.  Doctors eventually discovered Al had two bleeding ulcers, and performed a seven-hour surgery to resection his colon, remove his gallbladder and redo his duodenum, part of the small intestine,  . It was the first time that Al had been in an intensive care unit, he told his TODAY co-hosts after returning to the show in January. Al was finally released from the hospital on Dec. 8, 2022.  However, Al says he only learned about the severity of his health issues after he left the hospital. His wife, Deborah Roberts, and younger daughter, Leila Roker, initially shielded him from knowing how sick he really was. “I was home for maybe two or three weeks, and as we were decompressing and debriefing, Deborah and Leila talked about how difficult and bad it was. (Then) my brother talked about it,” he says.  Earlier this year, Roberts said the ordeal was “the worst roller coaster ride you have ever been on” and at one point, the family “really did think we were going to lose him” while his medical team struggled to find the source of his internal bleeding,  . When Al found out how serious things were, ""I still was not anywhere near 100%, but I certainly was much better and once I knew, I felt like, well, that was bad, but I'm past that,"" he says.  Reflecting on his health scare and this time last year, Al says that he was already feeling motivated to return to TODAY and work toward recovery. He was especially looking forward to his knee replacement surgery, which he underwent in May. ""(I thought) well, what are you going to do? I’m just going to get better, and here we go, it’s next year,"" he says. “I’m not one much for looking back. I would prefer to look forward."" It was a long road to recovery, but patience and positivity helped tremendously. “I’ve had a number of visits to the hospital, and I’ve been used to snapping back pretty quickly, but as we get older, we don’t snap back as quickly,"" he says. ""I think (for me) it was a combination of severity and age ... but it may take you longer and you just have to kind of accept that,” says Al, adding he used a line from the movie ""The Incredibles"" as one of his life mantras: ""We get there when we get there."" “Maybe you didn’t get there as fast as you wanted to, but as long as you get there, it’s OK,” he says. When asked how his health scare changed his outlook on life, Al says it has strengthened the idea that ""life can turn on a dime. ... We know that intellectually, but when you’re faced with it, it really does hit home.""  “(Life) is an ephemeral gift that we’re given, and you need to appreciate and honor it,” he adds. These days, Al says he tries to be much more intentional about making sure the people in his life know how he feels about them — whether it's giving extra goodbye hugs or saying ""I love you"" more on the phone. “We’re really not guaranteed anything,” he says. Throughout the ordeal, Al has been touched by the outpouring of support and well wishes from his TODAY family and fans. ""It was the little things that are not so little ... like having the TODAY show staff show up and carol, that was the first time  ,"" Al says. People still check in and ask how he is doing more than one year later, he adds, which is ""very appreciated."" “I don’t think you can discount the power of positive thinking and the power of prayer, and I was the beneficiary of a huge amount of both,"" he says.  Another emotional milestone during his recovery was the birth of his first grandchild, Sky, in July. These days, Al says he is trying to stay as healthy as possible. ""I try to incorporate a little bit of activity (every day),"" he says, adding that lately he starts the day by doing his weather briefings on the treadmill. ""This way, I've knocked out 6,000 to 7,000 steps on the way to 10,000 for the day,"" Al explains. Even before his health scare and recovery, Al has been committed to walking and documenting his progress in the  . When asked if he has any advice for others, Al says his ""do what you can"" mindset helps keep him motivated and moving every day.  ""One of the many things I've learned from my wife is we do what we can. If you can't do four miles, what if you do a mile or a half a mile? ... Maybe it's not everything you wanted to do, but tomorrow is another day and you did something."" Al credits his granddaughter, Sky, as “another reason to get back in shape"" and looks forward to celebrating the holidays as a grandparent for the first time.

Aviva Klompas, a former speechwriter for Israel’s mission at the United Nations,   that she believed Sarandon was “saying that American Jews have it coming — that we don’t deserve to live free from harassment and assault.” In other comments at the rally, Sarandon said criticism of Israel should not be conflated with antisemitism. “There’s a terrible thing that’s happened where antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel,” she said,  . “I am against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia,” she went on to say. In a separate development, Spyglass Media Group confirmed that it had dropped Barrera, an up-and-coming actor, from the “Scream” horror series after a series of Instagram posts reportedly condemned Israel in strong terms. She also appeared to echo an antisemitic trope about Jewish control of the media, reportedly writing in one post: “Western media only shows the [Israeli] side. Why do they do that, I will let you deduce for yourself.” (NBC News has not seen the posts;  .) In a statement posted on social media Wednesday, Barrera said she would continue to speak out when she felt compelled. “First and foremost I condemn Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. I condemn hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people. … Every person on this earth — regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or socio-economic status — deserves equal human rights, dignity, and, of course, freedom,” she wrote. She stated she was praying for the end of violence and peaceful co-existence. “I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom. Silence is not an option for me,” the actor wrote. Barrera’s publicist did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Spyglass’ decision. Spyglass said in a statement, “We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.” The company co-produced the two most recent installments in the “Scream” series; Paramount Pictures handled distribution. Sarandon is a five-time Oscar nominee who won the best actress award for her performance in “Dead Man Walking.” She is also known for her roles in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” “Bull Durham” and “Thelma & Louise.” Barrera appeared in the fifth and sixth installments of the “Scream” franchise, and she had been set to appear in future installments. She also acted in the Starz series “Vida” and the big-screen adaptation of the musical “In the Heights,” released in 2021. The war between Israel and Hamas has roiled Hollywood. Maha Dakhil, an agent at Creative Artists Agency, drew criticism after she posted messages on social media that accused Israel of “genocide.” (She has removed the posts and apologized.) Some members criticized the Writers Guild of America after it did not immediately send out a statement condemning the Hamas assault, which killed more than 1,000 people. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 14,000 people in Gaza. Diana Dasrath is NBC News’ entertainment producer and a senior reporter.  © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

He said in his talk with Kylie he'd also spoken to Kim Kardashian, Rob Kardashian and Kris Jenner off camera. In his chat with the eldest Kardashian sister in the episode released on Nov. 23, Kourtney didn't hold back her feelings toward Tristan. ""I see these TikTok videos and there's these people and they're like, 'I am a sociopath narcissist. I have no empathy, no feelings.' Do you think there's any part of you that relates to that?"" she asked her sister's ex. ""You should definitely feel the way you feel, 100%, because if it was my sister, I'd feel the same way,"" he replied. ""I think for me, you know, I want Khloé to be happy and whatever that may be, I'm fully supportive of that."" When pressed by Kourtney, Tristan revealed that he wishes his family had stayed together but added, ""I've done things to put myself in a position out of that."" ""Yeah, like if the actions don't match the words, it's hard to believe the person with the actions,"" Kourtney said.  Kourtney went on to say that she feels like the women in the family are often too forgiving of the men who have wronged them in order to keep the familial peace. ""I feel like in this family, you guys are so lucky. Like, all the guys, because, for whatever reason, it's held a higher priority of like, 'Let's keep everyone happy and getting along,'"" she lamented, adding that she's been a part of the cycle in the past too. ""For some reason that  takes a priority in this family over, like, setting a boundary or taking having someone's back."" Later, in her one-on-one interview, she reiterated that point and said she wanted to set a better example for her daughter, Penelope. ""Everyone can tend to normalize these behaviors of some of the men in our lives and I don't want to show my daughter that's OK,"" she said. ""Having regret and giving grace I think is right, but also having really clear boundaries, I think, is really important.""

It then showed a flashback to April 27, 2023, when Kourtney was sitting in an office space with sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Kim and Khloé Kardashian, while mom Kris Jenner videotaped.  Each sister had an envelope and was instructed to open it. Inside was a black-and-white sonogram, confirming Kourtney was pregnant.  ""Really?!"" Kylie said, with Kendall adding, ""You're lying?!"" ""She's not lying,"" Kris, turning the camera on herself, said. Kylie was the first one to get up and hug Kourtney followed by Kylie, as Kim and Khloé seemingly remained shocked by the news.  ""It just happened naturally,"" Kourtney said, before Kim and Khloé went over and hugged her.  In their solo camera shots, Kim said, “The fact that she got pregnant is just such a beautiful thing. It’s what’s meant to be,” while Khloé added in her separate chat, “I’m so, so, so happy that this happened for her.” Kris appeared to be the most ecstatic for her eldest daughter, telling the cameras, “I’m so happy for Courtney and Travis.

During Season One of “The Kardashians,” Kourtney and husband Travis Barker,  , spoke about how they were attempting to  with in vitro fertilization treatments. However, Kourtney told in September 2022 that she had stopped IVF treatments after it had been unsuccessful. In the episode, Kourtney shared that she believes she got pregnant on Valentine's Day after they stopped treatments.  “People would always say to us, ‘The second you stop trying it’s just gonna happen,’” she said. “And we stopped doing IVF probably two months maybe before our wedding. And so it took a year, I think, for all of those hormones and chemicals to get out of my system. We were not trying whatsoever. I didn’t even check my ovulation anymore. We decided to put it in God’s hands. I thought it was just not happening and we were like accepting of it.” Kourtney would go on to share how they  at Travis' Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles.  While backstage at Travis' show, Kourtney shared the news with his friends, while the drummer teased that if it was a boy he would name him Rocky Thirteen. Travis previously teased the name on the Oct. 30 episode of the  , as well as explained in July during another interview that the moniker combines the name of a guitarist and “the greatest number of all time.” Kourtney revealed in the episode, “It was actually Travis’ idea for the way for us to make our pregnancy news known to the world.” Originally, the drummer wanted her to get on stage with him but Kourtney said she got really shy.

It was just such a fun way to announce our pregnancy to the world,” she continued, later adding that she was relieved she didn’t have to hide her pregnancy or be worried about North West “accidentally posting my belly” on social media.  The couple and their friends later joked backstage, wondering if people thought that Travis didn't know she was pregnant before the reveal.

After previously seeing the dress during a fitting via FaceTime, the then-9-year-old said she ""loved"" the look. ""This was the first time North said, 'Oh wow, that's beautiful,'"" Kim told Schiaparelli’s creative director Daniel Roseberry, who designed the dress. But North ultimately thought Roseberry could have done better — and she shared her thoughts with him directly. ""I like the pearls. I just don't like that it comes from the dollar store,"" she said at one point in the conversation. She thought the dress made her mom look like a “Hawaiian girl with her dress all ripped.” According to  , Kim's draped skirt and top were made from ""over 50,000 freshwater pearls and over 16,000 crystals.""  North said there were “way too (many) gaps in the pearls” in the outfit, and that the ""diamonds ruined it."" Kim and Roseberry told North they agreed about the gaps in the pearls, which is why they restrung them. The dress took “one dozen artisans over 1,000 hours to create, as each strand of pearls was strung and draped to her body,” Schiaparelli added in its press release. But North’s critiques kept coming: She also didn’t like how “the pearls look fake.” On that, her mother was willing to go head-to-head. ""No, no, no, I think you're wrong here,"" Kim said. ""These are very expensive real pearls. I think you need a lesson on pearls. We're not going for, like, flapper girl, we're going for vintage, authentic, pearly girly."" Ultimately, North said she didn't see the vision. ""It's looking, like, beachy,"" she said. At that point, Roseberry chimed into the conversation and said he was watching his ""worst nightmare"" unfold. ""It's like I'm being punked,"" he said. ""The night before the Met — getting read for filth by a 9-year-old."" Kim said she ""respected"" her daughter's opinion but asked her to go ""easy on her."" ""I am. But I'm not going to lie. I won't say it all if you don't want me to, but I won't lie,"" North said. Roseberry asked if North was staying for the fitting. ""I'm so nervous now,"" he said.  © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

So far, there are no immediate signs of terrorism, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters. “At this time, there is no indication of a terrorist attack,” she said. “Let me repeat that: At this time, there is no indication of a terrorist-involved attack here at the Rainbow Bridge in Western New York.” The two people who were killed were in the car that crashed, and at least one of them was from western New York. The car, which officials have said was traveling at a high rate of speed, was on the U.S. side of the border when it crashed, caught fire and exploded, contrary to some early reports that it had come from Canada. Hochul said she has seen video of the car, which was going at an “extraordinarily high rate of speed” before it went flying in an “absolutely surreal” scene. “When you see this video, your jaw will drop in disbelief at how this went so high, over an 8-foot-high fence,” she said. Rickie Wilson, who works for Gray Line Tours, couldn’t believe his eyes when he spotted the “airborne” vehicle. He said it appeared the car struck a cement median before it went flying. “I first thought it was an airplane. Looked like slow motion,” Wilson   of Rochester. “And I said, ‘My God, it’s a car, and it’s a vehicle, and it’s flying through the air.’” He estimated the car was 10 to 15 feet in the air. “I mean, how did it get up there? I mean, this thing was up in the air,” Wilson told reporters. “I know it sounds like I’m crazy, but the car was airborne, and not 3 or 4 feet — I mean, it was up there.” A Customs and Border Protection employee suffered minor injuries and was treated at and released from a hospital, a law enforcement official said. Hochul said that the employee was working in the booth and that “the booth literally protected that individual.” “This vehicle basically incinerated,” Hochul said. “Nothing is left but the engine. The pieces are scattered over 13, 14 booths.” An initial search didn’t find a secondary explosive or device, the law enforcement officials said, noting that was preliminary information. Authorities are investigating whether the crash was intentional. Hochul said at a news conference that the incident was “a horrific accident that led to a high-level anxiety all the way from western New York to Albany to Washington.” It occurred on one of the busiest travel days in the U.S., when people across the country hit the road for the Thanksgiving holiday. All western New York bridge crossings into the U.S. were shut down, the Erie County executive said shortly after the crash. Hochul later said all bridges had been reopened. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said that security has been increased and that the “city is on heightened alert due to the upcoming holiday.” The White House was also closely monitoring the situation, an official said. The Canada Border Services Agency   it was “liaising with our U.S. counterparts on this matter.” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that “at this time, there is no indication of a threat related to this incident” and that he has been in contact with Hochul and Canadian officials. The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said it would increase security systemwide. Travelers at Buffalo Niagara International Airport should expect additional screenings, and vehicles going into the airport will undergo security checks, it said. “The Buffalo and Niagara Falls Airports are fully operational. We advise travelers to give themselves time for these extra precautions in addition to holiday travel,”  . Amtrak said Wednesday that its Maple Leaf Train from New York City to Toronto would terminate at Niagara Falls because of the incident.

The suit, filed in New York Supreme Court on Wednesday, Nov, 22, alleges Foxx fondled the unnamed woman and further violated her after he stuck his hand down her pants. It was filed just two days before the expiration date for the New York Survivors Act, which gives adult sexual assault survivors one year to sue regardless of when the statute of limitations expired. Representatives for Foxx did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The woman alleges that she and a friend, both of whom had been sitting a table away from him, walked over to ask for a picture with Foxx, who had been having drinks with a co-founder and the owner of the business, Catch NYC & Roof. While they were taking pictures, an “intoxicated” Foxx “roughly” grabbed the woman’s phone and continued to take more pictures while also making suggestive comments like “Wow, you have that super model body,” according to the suit. Then, he grabbed her arm to pull her to the back of the rooftop, where he slid his hand under her shirt and began rubbing her breasts, the suit alleges. The woman tried to move away, but Foxx slid his hands into her pants and put his fingers on and in her vagina and anus, according to the court filing. A security guard saw what was going on but walked away anyway, the suit alleges. It adds that when the woman’s friend walked over, Foxx stopped touching her and walked over to the security guard. Also named in the suit are Catch NYC & Roof — the rooftop bar at 21 Ninth Ave. in New York — Catch NYC Inc., Catch Hospitality Group and Mark Birnbaum, the owner of Catch. Catch NYC and Birnbaum did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night. The suit alleges Birnbaum and those working at the bar that night did not do their jobs and were “negligent” in protecting their clientele. Birnbaum and Catch’s employees “had knowledge of Foxx’s propensities for aggressive behavior towards females, the potential for unwanted sexual touching and his bad disposition when consuming excessive alcohol,” the suit alleges. The woman alleges in the lawsuit that she required medical treatment because of the incident, experienced “pain and suffering” and continues to feel the effects of the assault, all of which caused her “severe emotional distress and anxiety, humiliation, embarrassment, post-traumatic stress disorder and other physical and emotional damages.” She is asking for unspecified damages.  Rebecca Cohen is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

The 72-year-old reality star appeared on the Nov. 21 episode of Justin Long’s   where he revealed that producers of the ""Bachelor"" spinoff reached out to him ahead of time to say he'd need to undergo an STD test as part of his background check. ""I was in Florida in February of this year. I was actually traveling with an old girlfriend. We were just friends. I got a call from ABC, wanting me to go to initiate the process to go get an STD test. And it’s like, that’s a little bit of a tender moment,"" Turner recalled, laughing. The retired restaurateur, who was married to his late wife, Toni, for 43 years before she died in 2017, reported to a nearby clinic, where he was clueless about how the test would be performed. “As I recall, that may have been my very first ever STD test,” said Turner. “I had no idea what was going to happen. I didn’t know if they were going to look in the iris of my eye, take a urine sample, a blood sample. I had no idea.” Turner apparently passed the test while also sailing through the rest of the stringent vetting process. “I had to send my fingerprints to the FBI. There were numerous background checks. There was a psychological evaluation that was like 360 questions and then another hour for an interview,” he said. “The vetting process is ridiculously thorough.” When “The Golden Bachelor” premiered in September, Turner met the show’s contestants, 22 women ranging in age from 60 to 75.

https://www.today.com/popculture/news/dolly-parton-husband-carl-thomas-dean-relationship-history-rcna125766,Everything Dolly Parton’s said about her decadeslong marriage to Carl Thomas Dean,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Country music legend Dolly Parton has been in the spotlight since the 50's. So it's surprising that the “Jolene” singer’s relationship with her husband, Carl Thomas Dean, has remained out of the limelight.  When Parton was just 13 years old, she sang on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee and her career skyrocketed since. Now at the age of 77, she is a pop culture icon with no shortage of appearances, albums and fame. Dean, who is from Nashville, is a businessman without any industry ties. In a recent interview for ""What Would Dolly Do? Radio,"" the singer gave insight into her long-standing private relationship. ""Carl has never been in the limelight and all, never wanted to be in it. He don’t like it,"" said Parton. She said that after one public outing, he knew that wasn't the life for him. ""He went to one thing with me early on when we first married to a BMI Song of the Year (event), and he came out there taking off his tuxedo, his tie and all that and said, 'Don’t ever ask me to go to another one of these damn things because I ain’t going,'"" she said. ""I never asked him and he never did."" But despite their different approaches to public life, the two have had a lasting relationship, celebrating 57 years of marriage this past May. Here's a look back at the major events in their relationship, from their first meeting at a laundromat to his support for her music. Many people can live in a city for years before going on a date, but Parton met her husband on her very first day in Nashville. She told the New York Times that she brought a lot of dirty clothes with her, and stopped at the ""Wishy-Washy"" laundromat. ""After I’d put my clothes in the machine, I started walkin' down the street, just looking at my new home, and this guy hollered at me, and I waved,"" Parton  . ""Bein' from the country, I spoke to everybody. And he came over and, well, it was Carl, my husband.” In that 1976 interview, Parton had more to say about their first meeting. “I wouldn’t go out with him. I mean, that was somethin' we was taught. You gotta know somebody or they may take you on a back road and kill you. But I said, 'You’re welcome to come up to the house tomorrow because I’m baby‐sittin’ my little nephew.'"" She said he came over every day for a week, and they sat on the porch and talked. ""I wouldn’t even take him in the house,"" she said. But the first day she didn't have to babysit, she said that Dean took her to meet his parents. ""Cause he said he knew right the minute he saw me that that’s the one he wanted.” After dating for about two years, Dean proposed to her and they wed in May of that same year. While preparing for her wedding, the upcoming nuptials caused tension between her and her then-manager, Fred Foster. “He asked me not to get married. He said it’ll make it so much harder if you’re married with all this promotion,"" she said in a 2012 interview with Chattanooga, Tennessee,  . “My mother-in-law had already sent out invitations,” Parton said. “It broke her heart because I said we had to call the wedding off.”   But that didn't stop the two from getting married in a more private ceremony the following weekend. Only her mother, Avia Lee Owens, and Pastor Don Duvall and his wife were present at Ringgold Baptist Church where they tied the knot. One of her most famous songs, ""Jolene"" tells the story of a woman begging for Jolene not to ""take her man."" Parton said this was inspired by a ""flirtation"" that her husband had with a woman working at the local bank. “She got this terrible crush on my husband,” Parton  . “And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us — when I was saying, ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.” In a 1986 interview with Ladies' Home Journal, republished in her book, ""Dolly on Dolly: Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton,"" the country icon spoke about how she had gotten ""wrapped up"" in an ""affair of the heart"" in 1982. She told the outlet she'd faced the disloyalty of ""a special friend, an affair of the heart, which just about killed me. Oh, I cried an ocean. But I ain’t gonna talk about it anymore,” she said, playfully. “I’ve got to keep some mystery.” Parton said at the time that she and Dean were not divorcing, reiterating what she has said years earlier. “We’ll just always be together,"" she told People in 1982. ""To him it’s all a joke. There ain’t a man in this world could ever live up to my husband. That’s one of the things that keeps me from going too far.” In a 1982 interview  , Parton confirmed that she'd been stuck at home in Tennessee for health issues alongside her husband. She joked that her months at home had ""just about busted"" their relationship. ""I'm glad to be going,"" she explained. ""He's glad for me to   going and so we're glad to get back to our abnormal."" In the Walters interview, Parton added that she and her husband were “flirts” but were faithful ""best I know how."" ""I just love people there and ... being a woman away from home, there are these good looking guys that come on to you pretty strong. And every now and then I like to come on pretty strong myself,"" she said. ""But I know that I've got something at home, that I wouldn't threaten or take a chance on losing for anything in the world."" In a 1997 interview with   in which she promoted her latest collection of dance club remixes, Parton explained that she and her longtime companion, Judy Ogle, was ""just an old maid"" and not her lover.  ""People think because she’s never married that she must be a lesbian, and because we’ve been together, that we must be lovers. But the fact is, I think Judy would rather be called a lesbian than an old maid,"" she quipped. ""If I was gay, I’d certainly never find a finer person than Judy as a mate. I’m as close to her just about as I am with (my) husband.” She also responded to rumors about her husband being out of the picture. ""They don’t ... see my husband because he hates being in the limelight. But I see him all the time,” she told the outlet. Parton added that the secret to her decadeslong marriage is simple. ""We just make a point to enjoy the stuff we enjoy and stay out of each other’s faces. I don’t get in his s---, and he don’t get in mine. And we get along great."" The Out interview, along with many others, were reported in the 2017 book “Not Dumb and Not Blonde: Dolly in Conversation.” The book — which cites Parton and Randy Schmidt as authors — collected and published interviews with Parton dating as far back as 1967. In May 2016, Parton and Dean  , but never got to have. The private affair was  , and she said they ""just had fun with it."" “I got all dressed up in the most beautiful gown you’ve ever seen and dressed that husband of mine up. He looked like a handsome dude out of Hollywood,” Parton told  . “We had a few family and friends around. We didn’t plan anything big at all because we didn’t want any kind of strain, any kind of tension, any kind of commotion, so we planned it cleverly and carefully. We just had a simple little ceremony at our chapel at our place. We just had just a few people who needed to be there to make sure they got the pictures and the few things that we needed."" Parton also said that their vow renewal inspired a large portion of her album ""Plain and Simple,"" which was released that August. In honor of her husband's birthday, Parton   that she knew he would love. In July 2021, she put on a Playboy bunny costume in his honor. “Remember sometime back I said I   when I was 75? Well, I’m 75 and they don’t have a magazine anymore,” she said in a   at the time. “But my husband always loved the original cover of 'Playboy' so I was trying to think of something to do to make him happy.” Parton was the first country star to pose for the now-defunct magazine, appearing on the cover in 1978. According to her  , her contract at the time had “very specific parameters that did not include nudity,” but she still wore the classic bunny suit. In her 2021 video, she said that she had a new cover made with her fresh outfit and ""the new Dolly."" “Well, the   new Dolly,” she said, good-naturedly. “In the first one, I was kind of a little butterball in that one. Well, I’m string cheese now.” “But he’ll probably think I’m cream cheese,” Parton said with a wink. “I hope!” The singer recently released her newest album titled ""Rockstar."" On ""What Would Dolly Do? Radio,"" she spoke more about her husband's reaction to hearing the album.  ""I played him the whole album and he said, which to me was the greatest compliment in the world, he said, 'You know, it’s pretty good,'"" she said. ""That would be like anybody else saying, 'Oh, that’s best I ever heard. That’s just so fantastic.'"" She said Dean has always been honest with her about his opinions. ""I had done a couple of things in the past, just some rock things. He said, 'It’s OK. It’s OK,'"" Parton added. ""He’s very honest. We have such a great relationship.

From the L.O.L. Surprise! dolls that come with multiple   to the Hatchimals that are wrapped in exciting blind packaging to make collecting even more fun, these toys have been popping up on store shelves and   over the last few years. In 2021, a new kind of toy entered the category and took the surprise factor to the next level — with magic! The Magic Mixies Magical Misting Cauldron has been one of the hottest toys holiday season since releasing, and as a result, repeatedly sold out during prime shopping months. (And it wasn't just kids who were under its spell, many adults were astounded by the fun, interactive experience, too.) Last season, the brand added a new toy to the Magic Mixies lineup, the Magic Mixies Magical Crystal Ball. And this year, the brand put its own magical spin on a Genie Lamp and even entered the doll category with their ""Pixlings""!  For anyone wondering what the hype is about, we're sharing everything you need to know about the popularity of the original toy and how it works below. Plus, we're highlighting all the exciting details about the newest versions, which have become some of the hottest toys this holiday season. The newest Magic Mixies toy, puts a cute spin on the mystical genie lamp. The toy will lead your little one on a magical adventure that required them to complete several fun steps (and shout out a magic word!) to unlock and release the genie inside. According to the brand, it feature over 60 different lights, sounds and reactions, including magical mist!  It’s also on the Amazon bestsellers list — it’s No. 1 in the   category! Plus, it's a big hit for shoppers, who are loving it for its interactive and fun features. ""This genie is so fun!"" raves one five-star reviewer on Amazon. ""My kids have had several toys in the past that you have to do some sort of activity for it to open, but this one takes it to the next level. There were several steps that go along with a short narrative explaining to the kids what you are doing. It has lights, sound, and even smoke. The entire time the excitement is building as the arrival of the geenie gets closer. My kids also love repeating the whole process over. So smart and fun!"" Grab one while it's 25% off during  ! This Magic Mixie toy requires some potion making and another magical word to make your Mixie appear. (You'll know you're close when your elixir starts to turn blue!) Shop TODAY editorial director Adrianna Brach recommends using this toy on a table or countertop because it can get a little messy with the potion. But a little mess sometimes makes the most fun! The Magical Crystal Ball promises to combine the fun, interactive features and magical elements of the original toy in a new form. The crystal ball is said to feature more than 80 sounds, lights and reactions. And when kids use the wand and say the magic words, it fills with mist and a Mixie appears. They can then play with the toy, tickling it, asking it questions (its forehead gem will light up with the answer) or making it disappear and reappear. At night, it can even be switched to night-light mode and kept on their nightstand. Plus, it'll arrive in time for Christmas! So it's perfect for holiday gifting. It won the Creative Toy of the Year award during the Sept. 2022 Toy of the Year Awards and was one of the hottest toy picks of 2022, according to multiple retailers. If you tried getting the original toy for your little one (or yourself) in the past, there's a good chance that you came up short. For most of the 2021 holiday season, the product was sold out across retailers, which isn't surprising given how buzzy it was. It won the Creative Toy of the Year award at the Feb. 2022 Toy of the Year Awards and was featured in  . But even years later, the fuss around the toy hasn't seemed to slow down — more than 13,000 shoppers have given it a five-star rating, with many raving about how creative the toy is and how much their kids love it. ""This cauldron captured my 8 year old grand daughter's attention and held it,"" one shopper said. Another reviewer said that they were not prepared for how cool the toy was going to be, and ended up getting excited about the process. ""The ingredients, the mechanics of the cauldron, the wand, the fog... it was amazing,"" they said. ""I started out helping my kid — just to make sure he did it right — and I was 100% immersed by the second ingredient ... Is it too much to ask the company to make one for 40 year olds?"" It's not rare to hear about an adult trying out the toy for themselves. Videos in the   on TikTok have more than 817 million collective views, and many of them feature people of varying ages casting their spells in the cauldron. ""At the age of 24-years-old, this is probably one of the most exciting purchases I've made in a long time,"" one TikToker said. Made for kids ages five and older, the Magic Mixies Cauldron allows children to ""experience real magic,"" as they add ingredients and tap their wand to create a new furry friend, the brand shares. The kit comes with a spell book to follow and everything a kid needs to work their magic. According to reviewers, the cauldron is ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box — no charging required! You can start the potion by adding water to the cauldron (to activate it), then inserting various ""magical"" included ingredients — like the Fizz Feather, Magic Feather, Sound Dust and more — stirring and tapping three times with the wand after each one when the green light appears. After the final three taps, you'll see mist rise from the cauldron and the Magic Mixie will emerge. But the fun doesn't end there though — the Mixie itself reacts to touch and responds to the wand with lights and sounds, so you can play with it for hours. While some shoppers have voiced their frustration with the high price point for a one-time experience, you can actually repeat the process time and time again. After the first use, you can simply remove the cauldron's bottom half, clean it, put the Mixie back in and use the included key to reset the toy (you can see step-by-step instructions,  ). The brand offers a  , with mist and ingredient refills, but   you can also use other ingredients that you have around the house, like baking soda and salt. This is a great gift for the little one who   a surprise. Commerce leadership coordinator Alexa Arent did a bit of a deep dive on the   and says this Magic Mixie is a true fan favorite. ""Here is a twist on our beloved toy. COLORS!,"" she said. ""My friend Devon said her daughter just asked for this and says it is different given the choice and surprises of color! AND there is a refill option, giving buyers the gift that keeps on giving.” If you're looking for something more affordable, the brand has a line of Magic Mixlings, which was one nominated for Collectible of the Year at the TOTY Awards. There are more than 40 collectible figures and each one comes with a mini cauldron and a magic wand that can be used to discover your Mixling's powers — like a Spellster that glows in the dark, a Vanisher that becomes transparent in water or one of the many other varieties.

https://www.today.com/parents/moms/allyson-felix-pregnant-rcna126421,Olympic champion Allyson Felix is pregnant: See her loving announcement,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Allyson Felix is pregnant and expecting her second child, the Olympic champion announced the day before Thanksgiving. , the most decorated U.S. track and field athlete in Olympic history, shared an Instagram post with her husband, Kenneth Ferguson, and daughter Camryn, who turns 5 on Nov. 28. Felix is holding a sonogram photo and Camryn holds a sign announcing that her baby brother is due in April. Felix retired from sports in 2022, after winning 11 Olympic medals. She has become a passionate advocate for women in sports as well as for maternal health.  She experienced a traumatic birth with Camryn in 2018, and earlier this year she spoke out on the death of her track and field teammate  . In June, Felix said she would love to have another child. “That’s something that I know for sure,” she wrote in an essay for Time magazine about Bowie's death. “But will I be here to raise that child? That’s a very real concern. And that’s a terrifying thing. This is America, in 2023, and Black women are dying while giving birth. It’s absurd.” “I’m hopeful that things can get better,” Felix added. The U.S. has the worst maternal mortality rate among industrialized nations, and the maternal mortality rate for Black women in the U.S. is more than double that of white, non-Hispanic women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Speaking to TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager in September, Felix said retiring from competition has been hard. She's now an entrepreneur, as co-creator of the brand Saysh, which makes running shoes specifically designed for women. She said she really enjoys ""the little things"" of motherhood: ""Taking her to school, and karate, and soccer practice, and hearing what's happening in her little day. I just really find so much joy from watching her grow."" Felix said her daughter has helped inspire her advocacy for women. ""She just really showed me and made me think about the world that she's going to grow up in,"" Felix told TODAY. ""She's motivated me to keep pushing and not to accept the status quo."" Felix has battled for better policies for pregnant athletes. In 2019, she revealed   that Nike said it would pay her 70% less than she earned before she became a mom, despite her accomplishments, and also said that the company wouldn't guarantee she wouldn’t be punished if she didn’t perform at her previous levels in the months around childbirth. The  that guaranteed an athlete’s pay and bonuses for 18 months surrounding pregnancy. In a powerful photo Felix once posted to Instagram showing her C-section scar and her many medals, she recalled her personal journey. ""When you get knocked down, get back up,"" Felix  . ""Be brave with your life because you’ll have an impact on people that you never thought was possible."" Rebecca Dube is the Head of TODAY Parents, Digital, and a mom of two boys.

Here are the details,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands  is here, and what better way to celebrate than by treating yourself to a Starbucks’   in honor of the holiday? If you’ve already moved on from the fall beverage, no worries — there are plenty of other beverages to enjoy on Turkey Day and pretty much every other day of the year, too. Better yet, the coffee roaster just released its 2023   along with this year’s highly anticipated  . And you know what that means? Yep, the holiday season has officially begun. Commence   and listening to   immediately.  In the meantime, whatever   you’ve got on the docket to celebrate the holiday this year, if swinging by Starbucks to pick up a beverage is one of them, chances are good that you’ve come here wondering if Starbucks is open on Thanksgiving. It’s a reasonable question, given that many restaurants and retailers are closed in observance of Thanksgiving. In fact, quite a few stores  on Turkey Day. That said, there are plenty that will still be open to welcome customers. If you’re curious to know which ones, we’ve gathered them together (yes,  totally intended) right  . But what about Starbucks? Can you still get your  , Frappuccino, cappuccino or other favorite drink on Thanksgiving? Here’s what you need to know about Starbucks’ store hours this year. The answer is: Maybe.  If your Thanksgiving plans include hitting up a Starbucks drive-thru on your way to grandma’s house, then your best bet is to check to see if your local store will be open before going. According to a Starbucks spokesperson, “Store hours vary by location and stores may occasionally adjust their hours based on business and customer needs.” Based on that, the spokesperson suggests that customers “look for specific store hours using the   or by visiting our website store locator:  .” Put simply, your best bet is to check local hours before you head on over because knowing whether or not your nearby Starbucks is open before you go will save you the time and trouble of going there if they aren’t.

https://www.today.com/parents/how-survive-thanksgiving-divorced-parent-t119198,A divorced parents' guide to surviving Thanksgiving without your kids,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Thinking about   conjures up some stock images: a big turkey on the table, extra trips to the supermarket, and clinking full glasses with family and friends as children play happily underfoot. For many Americans, though, the picture is an incomplete one.   takes its toll all year round, but on   — a holiday meant to celebrate togetherness — its wounds can feel fresh as parents celebrate the holiday without their children. I’m a mother of six, so you might assume my table is never empty. I am keenly aware, though, of each year I do not have my two sons from my first marriage with me at the Thanksgiving table. I feel their absence acutely — not only because I love them tremendously, but also because it drives home the idea that family life doesn’t always end up looking the way I imagined it would when I put on that white wedding dress. Divorced parents without their children might feel not so excited about cooking a meal, for example; or, in a bad year, even getting out of bed. There are ways, though, to ease the stress of a Norman Rockwell holiday when the portrait of your own life has changed so much from what you thought it would be. “Perhaps your Thanksgiving holiday this year is not going to be what you might have envisioned, but this is an excellent time to embrace change,” said Leah Klungness, a psychologist and parenting expert. “Try not to wallow in self-pity or hold up your life in comparison to media images of Thanksgiving and families — because those are just images and are most likely fantasy to a large degree.” Who says you can only roast a turkey on the fourth Thursday in November? Living in the land of the free means you can celebrate with your children whenever you want. Many parents of divorce create their own workarounds. Michelle Retik of Short Hills, New Jersey does an annual “early bird” Thanksgiving the night before the holiday, inviting friends to make the night festive for her and her kids. “I alternate years (with my children) with my ex, and this was a way for us to still have our Thanksgiving together,” Retik said. “It’s even more fun because we invite friends who might not otherwise have been able to come!” “Think about it from your kids’ point of view, too,” divorce and life coach Karen Finn wrote in her holiday tips for divorced parents one year. “Most kids love the holidays, and having double the holidays — one with Mom and one with Dad — might be something the kids think is great!” Thanksgiving is a day to focus on gratitude — so what are you grateful for? Obviously your children, but maybe there are other focal points for you as well. Thanks to technology, you can certainly be in touch with your children on Thanksgiving Day to tell them how much they mean to you — but you can also reach out to friends and family who have been there for you to show them how significant they are in your life, every day. Try to stay off social media, parenting expert Julie Ross says: “If you're missing your kids, the absolute worst thing you can do is to see pictures of them on Facebook or Instagram having a great time with your ex.” This is also a good time, if you find yourself alone on the holiday, Klungness says, “to do what you constantly complain you don’t have enough time to do but you want to get done.” Maybe there’s a book you’d like to read, a series you’d like to binge-watch, or a closet you keep promising yourself to clean out. Or maybe you’d just like to catch up on some rest. “It’s OK to take a nap,” Klungness says. “Do what feeds your soul and you will be that much better parent and person. Look at it as an opportunity, not some sort of divorce penalty.” (Pro tip: Don't watch ""The Parent Trap."" Just saying.) “Do something that can be 'your thing' on Thanksgiving or other holidays when your kids aren't around,"" says Ross. ""It may be celebrating with friends, going for a weekend away, or taking yourself out for a nice dinner. As long as it makes you feel special, it could be an opportunity to insert some self-care into the day.” Many charitable organizations are short-staffed on Thanksgiving and could use an extra set of hands.

But it's going to take many Alkean friends, including the gods themselves, the black flames of the afokena gloves, and all of Tristan's inner strength to finally deliver justice. It's the summer of 1987, and all 10-year-old Bug wants to do is go to the beach with her older brother and hang out with the locals on the boardwalk. But Danny wants to be with his own friends, so Bug is stuck with their neighbor Philip's nephew, Frankie. As the summer unfolds, these new friends learn some important lessons about family, friendship and finding their way in a complicated world. Nine-year-olds are still expanding their vocabulary list, so an expansive (and visually enticing!) thesaurus could be useful as they build on their confidence with choosing the right words. Whether your 9-year-old loves horses or reading, this box set will bring them to the world of Sasha Siler, a boarding school student who has a horse named Charm. With four books included in the set, your tween won’t need to wait for the next installment. “A nostalgic pick we remember from our own childhoods but really still a classic choice to get kids reading,” said one TODAY.com editor of this six-book set. From under sea adventures to run-ins with the abominable snowman, they’ll love the thrill that comes with turning every page. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/news/daryl-hall-john-oates-lawsuit-explained-rcna126396,Why is Daryl Hall suing John Oates? Inside the rock duo's turmoil,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The musical partnership between Daryl Hall and his Hall & Oates bandmate John Oates has hit a sour note. Hall, 77, filed a lawsuit and a request for a restraining order against Oates, 75, on Nov. 16 in Nashville Chancery Court, according to court documents viewed by NBC News. One of the most successful duos in rock history, Hall & Oates scored dozens of hits in the 1970s and '80s, including ""Rich Girl,"" ""Kiss on My List,"" ""Private Eyes,"" “I Can’t Go For that (No Can Do),"" ""Out of Touch,"" and ""Maneater,"" which all hit the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Hall's lawsuit falls under the category of “contract/debt.” The details of the suit are unclear because the case is sealed, a clerk of the court confirmed to NBC News. NBC News has reached out to a lawyer for Daryl Hall and reps for both musicians. Though Hall & Oates has not released new music in many years, the band has never announced a breakup and, in fact, had still been  . In January 2020, Hall told   that he was writing new songs for an album. Oates told the publication separately that he would “definitely jump on board later"" to add his own parts to the songs. However, last year Hall confirmed  to the that the album, which had been planned “before the pandemic,"" had been shelved. ""Perceptions changed, life changed, everything changed,"" Hall explained.

https://www.today.com/parents/how-tell-thanksgiving-story-your-kids-t200911,How to tell kids the real story behind Thanksgiving,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The story most people heard about Thanksgiving from a young age is pretty simple: A group of Pilgrims, fleeing religious persecution, sail to North American and settle on Plymouth Rock. After a hard winter, they celebrate a successful harvest with their new neighbors, Native Americans. Everybody's grateful; the end. But that's not the full story. The Wampanoag tribe, the Indigenous people who lived at Plymouth Rock, experienced this moment very differently. Are your kids ready to hear the real history? The answer is probably yes. “Parents can start by telling their kids the truth and offering their children the more complex narrative. Kids are smart and capable of understanding,” Matika Wilbur of the Swinomish and Tulalip tribes tells TODAY.com. She co-hosts the podcast  , which aired an episode called "" "" that aims to understand the Wampanoag perspective. “Thanksgiving is rooted in a historical fallacy,” Wilbur says, and the story is tied to the idea of white supremacy. ""The main Pilgrim narrative coincides with colonization that was inherently oppressive and brutal.” Parents might balk at introducing the ""real history"" to their children because they think their children can’t handle it. But that’s not giving them enough credit, Wilbur says. Wilbur — who traveled to over 400 Tribal Nations for her documentary "" "" — and her co-host Adrienne Keene, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation who is an assistant professor of American Studies and Ethic Studies at Brown University, spoke with Paula Peters and Linda Coombs, Wampanoag historical scholars, for the episode. Peters says sharing the Wampanoag perspective is essential but can be tough for parents. “It’s difficult because we have to talk about some raw topics in order to get a fuller, clearer understanding,” Peters, a citizen of Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and a researcher and journalist, tells TODAY.com. “Quite honestly, cherry picking that moment when the Wampanoag and Puritans happen to break bread as the ‘Kumbaya’ moment really does not do it any justice. The Wampanoag have been marginalized and forgotten and the back story is so incredibly critical for what ultimately happens.” Prior to the Pilgrims landing, the Wampanoag had experienced a plague that devastated their community. A ""plague"" is something Peters thinks children can certainly understand these days. “This is all (relevant) right now,"" she says. “Think of what we (had) to say to our children, why they (couldn't) go to school and parents (couldn't) go to work — to protect our elders."" She says how parents share information with their children is “very personal” but believes they should introduce Indigenous history early and encourage their children to think critically about what they read. The Wampanoag people did not rush out to welcome the newly arrived Puritans, for example. They took months to observe them. “Being able to talk about the true trepidation that the Wampanoag had with forging a relationship (is important),” she says. “It wasn’t like new neighbors moved in. It was very different.” Children definitely get what it's like meeting someone new who seems unlike them. “That is a creative and personal way to make it clear ... You get a new neighbor next door. They don’t speak your language. They don’t go to the same church. They do everything differently,” Peters says. “How are you going to engage with these people? These were all questions the Wampanoag leader had to ask himself.” The Wampanoag tribe also knew that other people who were like the Pilgrims had raided their food supplies in the past, so they felt wary. “What if you had a new neighbor that moved in and the first thing they did was take your cereal and Cracker Jack and not even leave a note?” she says. “These were new neighbors who came on the same kinds of ships that would have stolen from their fathers, their cousins, their uncles.” Another part of the story that parents can encourage their children to think deeply about is that role of Tisquantum, aka ""Squanto,"" who served as a liaison because he spoke English. “We all had this story of the Mayflower and Plymouth colony and wasn’t it wonderful that they came and they met with Squanto and he spoke perfect English?” Peters said. “Children are going to question, ‘Well, how did he learn to speak English?’” That’s a natural place to add more information. Squanto had been kidnapped by European settlers and held captive as a slave years earlier. “The answer to that involves all of those other things, being kidnapped, the plague,” she said. “Those parts of the stories are very tragic.” There are few books by Indigenous writers for children looking at the history of Thanksgiving, Peters says. And, Wilbur says only a handful of states — including Montana, Washington, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Mexico and New York — mandate Indigenous history in the curriculum. Parents can reference these curricula online or turn to something like the Smithsonian’s   for resources. “It should be in the schools,” Peters said. Peters participated in  , the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower landing. The website and events includes Wampanoag history. Parents can explore this and the British sister project, Mayflower 400, to learn more. “There was a great interest worldwide in learning the true story,” she says. “We were a little bit nervous: ‘Would they really hear us?’ In the past there has been a history of not interpreting what we say properly.” But people did want to listen. “I was really surprised by how welcome it was,” Peters says. Peters suggests that families who want to learn more start by learning the Indigenous history of where they are. You can   to see what Native American tribe lived where you live now. “The very first thing they can do is acknowledge where they live,” she says. “Just understanding where you are and whose ancestral land it is and just asking the hard questions about history.” Wilbur agrees. “The path to reconciliation begins with developing relationships with the Native people whose land we occupy. Everywhere in North America has an Indigenous history and story, and there are still Indigenous people living here,"" she says. ""There is an opportunity to build relationships with Indigenous people and support their cause."" And families who want to do more can even create new traditions. “They could become an ally to Indigenous communities by supporting their causes, either with donated time or money,"" Wilbur says. ""Thanksgiving allows all of us to evaluate how we are being of service to community, so rather than centering what I’m grateful for once a year, we could ask ourselves, 'How we are expressing that gratitude in a way that gives back?'” Meghan Holohan is a digital health reporter for TODAY.com who covers patient-centered stories, women's health, disability, rare diseases among other topics. She enjoys cooking, yoga, reading, music and walking her two rescue dogs.

https://www.today.com/popculture/music/enrique-iglesias-trilogy-tour-final-album-rcna88048,Enrique Iglesias reveals when his final album will be released,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Enrique Iglesias says that “since day one” he’s enjoyed getting up close and personal with his fans.  “I used to get people that I didn’t know from the audience... up on stage, security goes crazy and it drives them insane,” the singer tells TODAY.com about serenading his fans during his shows. “I’ve always done that since day one. I think when you write a song, something that’s very personal, if you could be serenading one person that has so much emotions going through their mind and so happy to be next to you, you’re singing a song they like, it’s just magical.” It's no secret that Iglesias fans love getting as close to the singer as possible. However, sometimes   — even sneaking a kiss, lunging at him and not letting go.  For Iglesias, he says he enjoys seeing how someone will react when he chooses them from a crowd — but notes it could go two ways. “Sometimes you get somebody on stage, some people will just freeze, some people will just act crazy, jumping up and down,” he says. “I personally love that. I’m going to start doing that on this tour.” Fans of the “Bailando” crooner will get a chance to catch the singer’s attention during his current tour. Since mid-October, Iglesias has been touring with Ricky Martin and Pitbull for “The Trilogy Tour.” A month into the concerts, it was announced that the tour was being extended with 18 new shows taking place in 2024. Iglesias couldn’t be happier.  Iglesias and Pitbull previously went on tour in 2017. Iglesias and Martin also teamed up in 2021 for their own series of concerts.  While reminiscing about his early concerts and the fans going wild, he says he’s thinking about bringing fans up on stage again. So how can one lucky fan capture his attention? “When you’re in an arena, with thousands of people, I think what makes a good serenade is when you can focus on one person,” he says. “There’s specific moments when you see someone that captivates you and it might be a movement or a look on their face.” Three decades into his successful and global career, Iglesias is set to release his final album. Yes, his last one. Back in 2021, the Grammy winner announced that he would only be releasing two more albums. “Final (Vol. 1)” was his 11th studio album and dropped in September of that year. While chatting with TODAY.com, Iglesias confirmed that “Final (Vol. 2)” is completed, it will, in fact, be his last album and be released in next year.  “It’s finished. It’s actually coming out in February,” he shares. “It’s completely finished. What I want to do is shoot one or two videos right before the second leg on the tour and launch it.” “I’ve been working on this album for quite a bunch of years. And for me it was always like I said, my final album... this is it,” he continues. “I don’t think — no,  , I won’t be doing any more albums.” He released the first “Vol. 2” single, “Así Es La Vida” featuring Maria Beccera, in October.  Iglesias notes that it doesn’t mean he’s not going to continue making music. He will still release singles and work on music. “For me, in my life, I think this is that final one.” In the meantime, check out how you can catch Enrique Iglesias, Ricky Martin and Pitbull on tour with the newly-added 2024 “The Trilogy Tour” dates and the remaining 2023 shows.

If you’re looking to get the biggest bang for your buck, Julie Ramhold, Consumer Analyst with   suggests to shop around because many retailers will have the same product at different prices.  “So many different stores will have so many sales competing that there’s a good chance you can find a lower price on something that you want. Be sure to look at retailers you might not ordinarily shop at to see if they have better deals than your tried-and-true stores,” Ramhold previously told Shop TODAY.  Both shopping experts agree that the average Black Friday discount varies. For very popular items, McGrath says you can expect a more modest discount that’s up to 20% off. But with other items such as clothing and door-buster items, they say retailers will likely mark down between 40% and 70% off.  The experts say that really depends on what you’re looking to buy with categories being different each year. Ramhold says some years the highest discount for clothing has been on Black Friday but then on Cyber Monday the next year. However, McGrath mentions she’s typically seen Black Friday be the best day for TVs, game consoles,   and appliances.  “If you are eyeing a specific item, we recommend you buy it as soon as a retailer kicks off its ‘official’ Black Friday sale, as popular items tend to sell out fast on Black Friday,” said McGrath.  In recent years, the shopping event has really turned into a major shopping weekend. And now, with so many early events this year, it’s turned into a deal-shopping season.

As a result, they experience conflict between how they want to behave (""Let's take some deep breaths"") and how they actually behave (""Don't make me turn this car around!""). Parents are expressing their frustration in hilarious ways on social media. Even a quick glance at TikTok shows that "" "" videos have 520 million views so far. The videos show parents' desire to stay calm, cool and collected even when they want to shout one of the following staples of their own childhood:  These days, timeouts have been demoted to Voldemort status, and instead, we are supposed to sit with our children while they work through their emotions — which can take longer than reading the entire Harry Potter series out loud. Sure, we try our best to communicate with our kids and open up channels for them about their feelings ... but man, after saying, ""I know you're disappointed"" 50 times in two minutes, all you want to do is scream, ""I told you what would happen if you let go of that balloon!!!"" On Nov. 18, ""  perfectly encapsulated the flop sweat of gentle parenting midway through their Thanksgiving Week Airport Parade sketch. As two flight attendants watch and laugh at the holiday chaos that surrounds them, they spot a harried father and his entitled daughter. Struggling to hold on to his child, the father says, ""Your feelings are valid, but Daddy wonders if there's a more productive way to express yourself because we want to have a good Thanksgiving, right?"" ""Screw you, b----!"" the daughter says in response. ""Sometimes, you just gotta whoop 'em!"" says one of the flight attendants. ""Whoop 'em!"" Sure, you want to reason with your child and process feelings in a calm and emotionally intelligent way, but what can you do when your kid is asking for it? Phelyna Ngu (or @thebossbabeexperience on TikTok) created this video that reads, ""When I have to remind my children that I am the first generation of gentle parenting and we can do this old school if we need to 😂"" along with a video of Vince Vaughn saying, ""We can handle this sh-- like gentlemen. Or we can get into some gangster sh--"" from the movie ""Be Cool."" Children are the future, and we should let them lead the way and all of that, but sometimes it just feels cathartic to   and yell the same way you were screamed at by your parents who were just doing what their parents did to them. At least in our generation, the threat of a wooden spoon was generally hypothetical. But parenting in any decade can truly drive a human to the brink. This video by @thatrelatablemama demonstrates the lengths parents will go to hide the madness by using a meme of a silently screaming woman with the text: ""POV: you're a first gen gentle parent and committed to not screaming at your kids so sometimes you have to hide in the pantry and have a menty b before parenting."" A ""Menty b,"" aka mental breakdown, does often feel imminent. The Bump and @alexandramcfly posted a video of Michael Scott from ""The Office"" holding up a speaker while DMX's ""Party Up"" plays in the background with the famous line, ""y’all gon’ make me lose my mind.""

In this video, she shows her reaction to ""When it randomly occurs to me that I have a 10 year old and at 10 I was basically trusted to raise my siblings alone.

And in the clip, Molly Ringwald's older sister says, ""Darling, is something bothering you?"" in a soft, calm voice.

On screen is a gif of Mr. Ron Burgundy, the ""Anchorman"" himself, shrieking, ""Oh no! Grab the children! Save the children!"" (And in case you didn't know, "" "" is gentle parenting-speak for being able to control your emotional state.) @Tank.Sinatra perfectly expresses the modern parent mashup of today's gentle approach and yesterday's authoritarian approach with this video. He crouches down to a child's eye level and with a calm and measured tone, he says, ""I know you're frustrated, okay? I know you're having these big feelings that you don't know what to do with.

https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/squid-games-the-challenge-producers-speak-out-rcna126306,"‘Squid Game: The Challenge’ producers on new games, twists and why they ‘broke all the rules’","Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The series premiere of “Squid Game: The Challenge” begins with 456 players walking into an enclosed space with a giant robot doll at the opposite end. She begins to sing a song in Korean, indicating that the first challenge, Red Light, Green Light, has begun. After an anxiety-filled five minutes, the game ends and only 197 contestants remain.  Those who were eliminated—and many of those still in the running as future episodes show—instantly became nameless faces, briefly making an appearance on Netflix’s newest reality show before their chance to win $4.56 million dollars evaporated.  Throughout the first five episodes of the show, out Nov. 22, multiple contestants meet the same fate. But just like the hit Netflix series that the reality show is based on, some players become “main characters” who get to share their backstories and their motivations for competing on the show.  So how did the producers behind the series decide which contestants out of nearly 500 to highlight? Executive producer Stephen Lambert tells TODAY.com that it was an “enormous challenge” the creative team faced early on during the filming process.  “We broke all the rules,” Lambert says. “You’re not meant to have more than 20 players if you want to make a good unscripted show. We had 456. So, I mean, that was an enormous challenge.” Fellow executive producer John Hay adds, “Everything about the show was on a different scale to anything any of us had done before. So all we could really do was watch the action, see who’s put themselves forward, see who emerged, see who had interesting relationships (and) cover as many people as we could.” Some contestants, like mother and son duo Trey (Player 301) and Leann (Player 302), get plenty of screen time in Episode One through Five. Others, like Figgy (Player 033) — who reality television fans might recognize from “Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X”— briefly stand out before their sudden eliminations. Most are never introduced to the audience.  Lambert reveals that the producers found it difficult to concentrate on certain players because they were constantly leaving the game. Although Trey and Leann make it to the end of Episode Five, other highly featured contestants from the first batch of episodes, such as Lorenzo (Player 161), Dani (Player 134), Spencer (Player 299) and Bryton (Player 432), are all eliminated. And Trey or Leann will likely not make it to Episode Seven since they have to compete against each other in the next round, which will likely been seen in Episode Six.  Given the high probability that the contestants with the biggest personalities might not reach the finale, producers decided to film the contestants in what Lambert calls the “processing room.” The interviews are similar to confessionals in other reality shows, but eagle-eyed viewers will notice that the contestants are speaking to the camera while wearing their normal clothes. The interviews were filmed before they were given their official “Squid Game: The Challenge” tracksuits and the games began.  Lambert explains that the processing room was where contestants discussed, “their lives and their families and their hopes prior to coming into the game.”  “Those interviews were kind of therapy,” he adds. They also allowed the show to constantly introduce new characters if a fan-favorite was suddenly cut.  He points to Spencer whose emotional journey on the show begins and concludes in Episode Two. Spencer is one of four contestants who must decide which shape to cut out from a cookie during the Dalgona round. As fans of “Squid Game” know, the umbrella is the most difficult shape to master. After being persuaded by three other competitors, Spencer begrudgingly accepts the umbrella, meaning he and everyone who is in his line must carve out the intricate shape.  Spencer panics during the round and nearly vomits multiple times before failing to complete the task. He is eliminated early, but Lambert says producers felt they needed to feature him in the final edit because he was “three-dimensional.”  “Then the baton would be passed to somebody else,” Lambert says. “Squid Game: The Challenge” doesn’t solely rely on the interviews for character development. The series also introduces new twists and games that deviate from the show’s plot.  When the contestants aren’t competing, they are still at risk of being eliminated. In the reality series, certain contestants can volunteer for special tasks or they are selected to perform the chore. They have to complete an activity to receive an advantage, like eliminating another contestant. “Squid Game: The Challenge” also added group votes and other unpredictable elements to help reduce the number of those participating. “The thinking behind all of those tests was that in the scripted show, the script is obviously doing a lot of the work of appointing people off, or leading you through those moments of choices about trust, betrayal and moral choices. And if we just did the big games, we wouldn’t necessarily get those dynamics,” Hay explains.  So, the team created “tests of character” to reveal more about the contestants’ varying strategies and loyalties.   In the first five episodes, the “tests of character” are doled out to certain contestants. Hays says the process was randomized.  “Sometimes individuals were picked out, sometimes there were games for the whole dorm. Sometimes there were games that anyone could play, or tests anyone could take. And it was revealing and interesting who stepped forward and took them,” he says.  In Episode Three, the contestants are surprised when they learn they must play “Warships”— similar to the board game “Battleships”—  in the third round instead of the tug of war game from the original series. Lambert says he hopes the new challenge makes viewers nostalgic and captures a big theme of the original show: the importance of childhood games.  “We wanted to (give) viewers the classic games of the drama, which everybody loved, but we also needed to come up with some surprises,” the exec says. The team chose Warships because they thought it would be “visually exciting” and force some players to “emerge as leaders to form alliances.”  Lambert teases that the remaining episodes of Season One will also include more unexpected challenges and dorm games. The next group of episodes will arrive Nov. 29.  Ariana Brockington is a trending news reporter at TODAY digital. She is based in Los Angeles. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Take a look at the cast two decades later,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Love actually is, still, all around.  This holiday season marks the 20th anniversary of the beloved Christmas film ""Love Actually,"" which first debuted in November 2003.  The 2-hour movie follows multiple love stories, most of which take place in the U.K., that overlap and intertwine with one another.  Here's a look back at the actors when the movie was first released, and what the cast looks like now.  As the newly minted prime minister of the U.K., Hugh Grant's character David quickly realizes he's falling for young staffer Natalie. Though taboo to be dating someone within the inner government circle, David's feelings can only be suppressed for so long, and the two are eventually caught kissing at the local primary school's Christmas play.

What dietitians want you to know,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands You’ve likely heard of Whole30 or maybe even tried it yourself. The diet involves eliminating sugar, dairy, grains, alcohol and other major food groups for 30 days — no calorie counting involved. According to the  , the program is designed to be a “short-term reset” which promises a variety of benefits, from weight loss to high energy levels. Since it came on the scene in 2009, Whole30 has garnered millions of followers and become a popular fad diet, especially around New Years resolution time. The diet is intense and restrictive — many people call it the Whole30 “challenge.” However, Whole30 has never ranked high   by experts. It didn't even make the list of overall best diets in 2023 from  . Despite having many critics, the 30-day elimination diet remains popular — likely thanks to social media. Proponents of the diet have flocked to Facebook and Instagram to share their Whole30 recipes, progress and results. There are over 4.4 million posts on Instagram using the hashtag #whole30 with countless photos of delicious-looking meals. So how does the Whole30 diet work and is it actually healthy? Here’s what experts say. Whole30 is basically an   — you cut out certain foods, namely processed ones. By following the Whole30 diet rules and not eating foods that are likely to contain common allergens or  , you can see how your body responds. That means no cheating — you’re expected to follow the program to the letter for 30 days. The idea is that by cutting these foods out, you'll learn which of them haven't been working for your body. After 30 days, you systematically reintroduce the forbidden food groups and pay attention to how they make you feel. In a way, you're using your body as a laboratory and testing what causes you to have a reaction and what doesn't. But that science-y sounding strategy doesn't mean that Whole30 isn't a diet. It definitely is. “  — it tells you what you can and can’t eat,” Karen Ansel, a New York-based registered dietitian and author of “ ,” tells TODAY. Unlike some diets, though, weight loss is not the goal of Whole30. You can   — you don’t have to count calories. While people may  , that's not what it was designed for. In fact, you’re supposed to stay away from the scale while you’re following Whole30. Whole30 has two distinct phases: Whole30 meals are built around one to two palm-sized protein sources. The rest of your plate is filled with vegetables. Healthy fats are included in  . You can include fruit occasionally. On Whole30, snacks are allowed, but not recommended — waiting three to five hours between meals is preferred. You can find information, resources, support and easy Whole30 recipes at  . On the Whole30 diet, you eat a whole-food-focused diet. Whole30 recipes include Whole30-approved foods like: The Whole30 meal plan eliminates foods that could trigger allergies, reactions or inflammation. That means these foods won’t make it onto your Whole30 shopping list: Samantha Cassetty, a registered dietitian based in New York City and the co-author of “ ,” tells TODAY that there’s no scientific evidence to support the health claims made by the Whole30 diet, and it wasn't designed by a credentialed expert. In fact, there’s little independent research that specifically evaluates the Whole30 diet. Anecdotally, people who have tried it share testimonials that it has helped them with a wide range of health conditions. “I know people who have tried it, and I don’t discount anybody’s personal experience,” Cassetty says. The diet can make you aware of how much processed food or added sugar you’re consuming, or how you’re interacting with alcohol. “When you come off it you can be more thoughtful about those types of things,” Cassetty says. But the diet eliminates a lot of foods that are generally considered healthy. “My concern with Whole30 is that there’s a long list of what you cannot have, and that includes foods that are linked to good health in many ways,” Ansel says. “When people are cutting out entire food groups, that’s always a big red flag.” Ansel is especially concerned that the diet doesn’t allow: Ansel also worries that a 30-day diet may set you up for yo-yo dieting. Cassetty agrees: “Phase diets get such a bad rap because people put their lives on pause to do something for a short period, then go back to eating what they used to before. Whatever benefits they experienced are immediately canceled out the minute they resume their former eating patterns.” Whole30 isn’t intended to be a long-term diet. By evaluating how you feel before and after Whole30, you may become more mindful about your eating habits and to learn to identify foods that are troublesome for you. Since there is no clinical research on Whole30, it remains to be seen whether this diet will hold up in the long-term. Talk with your doctor before starting the Whole30 diet or any other diet — your doctor can recommend the best eating plan for you, based on your health needs. “I think it’s overly restrictive,” Cassetty says. If you want to try a new way of eating, she recommends making small, sustainable, healthy changes like cooking at home more often and eating more vegetables. You might be considering the Whole30 diet if you suspect the food you eat is affecting how you feel. There are times when an elimination diet is appropriate, Cassetty says. But an elimination diet should be done under the guidance of a dietitian, for a specific reason. “You might not need to eliminate all of the foods that are eliminated on Whole30. If you’re having some problem, the goal is to eliminate as few foods as possible,” Cassetty says. “Foods like tofu, whole grains and pulses can absolutely fit into a long-term healthy eating plan,” Cassetty says. She pointed to the  ,   and   as good long-term options. “The  , who are living the longest disease-free lives, aren’t doing the Whole30.” Stephanie Thurrott is a writer who covers mental health, personal growth, wellness, family, food and personal finance, and dabbles in just about any other topic that grabs her attention. When she's not writing, look for her out walking her dog or riding her bike in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley.  © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Before heading into individual horoscopes, let's go over planetary happenings that will affect the collective. Two days after the Sun enters Sagittarius, action planet Mars also enters the planet of the archer, adding a spark of boldness and play to the steps we make.  The full moon in Gemini occurs on Nov. 27, urging us to implement the changes that we've been talking about since May 2022. Meanwhile, on Dec. 1, communication planet Mercury enters Capricorn, making our words more direct and concise. On Dec. 4, romantic Venus glides into Scorpio, adding an element of desire to our love lives.  In a possible weight off our shoulders, Neptune retrograde comes to an end Dec. 6, after appearing to move backwards since June 30. Now that the fog is lifting, we will be able to see things more clearly, but there could be some ambiguity to certain matters.   The new moon in Sagittarius on Dec. 12 offers a chance at finding meaning in our lives by exploring soulful and spiritual endeavors. On Dec. 13,  , suggesting that we revisit the past this holiday season and redefine our goals for the new year.  Here's a look at how the next month with impact your sign.  Taking a step back from an argument when you are right takes strength and reserve. Luckily, you’re acting with a higher mindset in the upcoming weeks that allows you to see the bigger picture of matters. You’ll also want to squash situations before they escalate in order to take on another dimension.   Your finances are in need of organizing. Ask a trusted friend for advice or contact someone who can suggest ways to get your financial issues in order. Having all information in front of you will be beneficial to your well-being.  Your closest relationships are bringing out both your finest qualities and your flaws. You're capable of managing these opposing forces within yourself. Nevertheless, it’s understandable if you feel frustrated by recurrent misunderstandings. Use your sharp mind and tender heart to navigate these energies.  When does your vacation begin? Can it start this minute? You are yearning for a trip out of town to restore and rejuvenate your essence and being. Even if you stay in town, you’ll relish the opportunity to heal and savor from spending time with your family.   The party never seems to stop when you’re around. The caveat is that you’re wanting to rest as much as you go out. Don’t overdo the social activities this month. Give yourself a chance to catch up on your sleep in order to add vigor to your always positive attitude. Home is where your heart is. You’re wanting to lay low and embrace a chill vibe in the coming weeks. It’s OK to sit back and indulge in the season’s merriment. You deserve a break once in a while and now is the time to focus on yourself. Get cozy!   Although you rarely say things you don’t mean, you might be biting your tongue in the weeks ahead. Triple check texts and emails before sending. Think twice before confronting matters with family and friends to ensure it doesn’t erupt into an argument. Try to check your tone and be nice.  No one knows better than you that maintaining boundaries is vital. If people choose to overstep the line you’ve drawn in the sand, then kindly remind them that they have to stay in their lane. Protect yourself. Happy birthday, Sagittarius! Embrace what makes you  this month. Then think about how you can become more yourself. Meditate on what you desire and believe it's possible. This holiday season give yourself the gift of silence. Remove yourself, for a bit, from the madness and learn to trust your inner voice. Instead of listening to podcasts or music with words, try out instrumental music or — better yet — nothing at all.  This month gives you the opportunity to reconnect with old friends. If you haven’t been in touch with them for a while, now is the chance to catch up and make a commitment to try harder to create a better foundation. Make new memories and reflect on the past together. Maintain a balance between work and personal life to avoid being overwhelmed by responsibilities on either end. Ideally, prioritize your personal life, so that you have the energy reserves to carry you through whatever comes next. Lisa Stardust is a New York City-based astrologer.

So we kind of had to dial it back a couple of keys and, you know, put our own tastes on it. And I thought it turned out really good.” The Christmas album is for the people.

As the report notes, it’s the   where your family’s heritage and traditions shine through, and extremely fancy, James Beard-nominated chocolatier Phillip Ashley Rix took that notion to heart when crafting his latest offering, the limited-edition  . The box of six chocolates (did I mention they are extremely fancy?) is priced at $35 and available to order  . By now you may be wondering why Campbell’s, fine purveyor of Goldfish crackers and condensed soups, is mentioned in the same article with a review of chocolate truffles. Well, maybe you should sit down. It’s because the sides Rix chose for chocolate truffle inspo are all casseroles containing Campbell’s soup. Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Celery, Cream of Chicken and Cheddar condensed soup infusions all make an appearance in the descriptions. I can scarcely wait to try them, but for you, dear reader, I will hold my soupy horses so we can talk over the flavors and take a peek inside. Even though they look spectacular in the official photo, I didn’t expect them to look this dreamy in real life. No wonder this brand is one of  . As shown, from top to bottom and left to right: Apple, Fennel, and Herb Stuffing; Hot Honey Mashed Sweet Potatoes; Green Bean Casserole; Jalapeño Cheddar Mac & Cheese; Everything Bagel Mashed Potatoes; and Baked Corn Casserole. Each one has layers of flavors in the coating and filling, and each is infused in some way with, yes, soup. Pictured is a plain black samples package, but the ones consumers receive when ordering online is boldly minimalist, with the iconic red and white colorblock of Campbell’s soup cans. Getting to taste something this beautifully decorated feels like an incredible luxury, until the words “cream of mushroom” come to mind. Is it possible this is something more than an elaborate joke? I’m frankly terrified of the Cream of Chicken-infused truffle, so let’s work up to it and try the Apple, Fennel, and Herb Stuffing first. This one is described as a “roasted apples, fennel, and Cream of Celery condensed soup bread pudding blond chocolate bonbon.” It is … a revelation. The apples and fennel taste completely natural, balanced but easily identifiable, and there is a breath of celery at the end. True apple in particular is difficult to capture in candy form, but this one is stunningly effective. Next, Hot Honey Mashed Sweet Potatoes: “sweet potatoes, thyme, local Memphis hot honey, Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup and milk in a chocolate bonbon.” It’s not very spicy, and the thyme is a scent rather than a taste, but the sweet potato flavor in an absolutely smooth chocolate filling is a real delight. I spend a moment trying to place the umami note and realize it’s cream of mushroom. I know that sounds beyond awful, but somehow, it isn’t. I’m feeling brave, or maybe foolhardy. Let’s try the Baked Corn Casserole, which promises “cornbread, sweet corn and Campbell’s Cream of Chicken soup in a white chocolate bonbon.” Thankfully, the chicken soup appears only as a welcome salty note in an otherwise delicately buttery sweet corn experience. There’s just a tad of masa-like texture to this adventuresome filling. As a devotee of  , I’m really looking forward to trying the Jalapeño Cheddar Mac & Cheese, featuring “Campbell’s Cheddar Cheese soup, triple cream Brie, and jalapeño-infused white chocolate ganache in a blond chocolate bonbon.” When I slice this one, the scent of cheese fills the air, and you can see a little truffled-out blob of cheddar. I admit hesitation, and this one might not be for everyone, but the brie, cheddar and jalapeño each come through with bells on, and they are singing my favorite song. White chocolate was the right choice for the coating. Next is Everything Bagel Mashed Potatoes, which I am surprised to see has a soft, translucent filling. “Campbell’s Cheddar Cheese soup caramel coated in a dark chocolate bonbon with everything bagel seasoning,” says the description, and I’m a bit worried about what chocolate will do to cheddar and vice versa. The sesame comes through, but the cheddar is just a little bit of a salty tang in an otherwise just plain fantastic chocolate caramel. I saved the Green Bean Casserole for last. I’ve had real tussles with candied   and   flavors before, and I lost. This time, let’s call it a draw. This is the most unusual of the flavors, with a distinct leafy green aspect, and the earthiness of the mushroom is more forward than it was in the sweet potato flavor. It   a chocolate truffle, but very surprising and complex, and I really appreciate that they didn’t pull the punch. I absolutely adored this collection. I love the saturated colors, the sophisticated twist in their shape, and flavors that are natural and delicious, but challenging. A lot of such novelty savory candies are just a fun prank, either phoning in a non-flavor, or leaning into a hilariously terrible one. These are a real achievement, making an effort to include every promised component in a coherent package, like a bite-sized episode of “Chopped” where the viewer gets to taste. The chocolate coatings are delicate in spots, but sturdy enough that you can cut each into little pieces so that everyone gets a chance to savor, and if you have a big table, you could consider getting the 12-piece   instead. The Thanksgiving Sides Collection is only available while supplies last, but the memories of such an ambitiously flavorful holiday adventure will last a lot longer than that.

https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologists-airport-food-rcna125502,12 foods cardiologists eat when they’re stuck at the airport and ‘worst’ foods they avoid,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Heart-healthy foods don’t exactly dominate the menu at the airport, where fast food restaurants rule and giant cinnamon buns beckon. So what’s a health-conscious traveler stuck at the airport to eat? Almost 5 million people will fly over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2023,  . The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen almost 3 million passengers on Sunday, Nov. 26, alone, which will likely be the busiest travel day,  . Many travelers face will delays and canceled flights if the weather doesn’t cooperate or airlines run into logistics troubles. That’s when airport eateries have a captive audience for foods that are easy and tasty to eat, but also full of fat, salt and sugar. Cardiologists know the temptation all too well. Dr. Susan Cheng, a professor of cardiology and the director of public health research in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, was at an airport recently when a cake display caught her attention. “It was humungous slices of all these lush, rich-looking different flavored cakes,” Cheng tells TODAY.com. “It was a beautiful display, but I don’t think I really want cake for lunch.” “  wherever you are, no matter the circumstances, is really probably your best bet,” adds Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “If you’re going to be at the airport for more than 24 or 48 hours, you’re going to have to get creative.” Knowing what they know about heart health, what do cardiologists eat when they’re stuck at the airport? Three heart doctors offered their routines The best strategy is to come prepared. “As much as you are absolutely captive at the airport, that does not mean that you cannot bring your own food,” Freeman says. He packs apples or oranges, which are surprisingly filling and fit in a backpack, plus portable   packets for a little extra protein. Freeman sometimes also goes to places where he can make his own salad and brings it to the airport. Cheng recently found a simple, nutritious tuna salad sandwich at an airport that she called “perfect.” Freeman, who doesn’t eat meat, likes to order a veggie sub without the cheese and mayo. “Sometimes they have a little avocado or hummus on the sandwich, which is surprisingly good,” he says. The goal is to find good foods that will keep you full, says Dr. Marc Eisenberg, a clinical cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York. “The best thing to eat is something like an omelet if you find a diner there,” Eisenberg, co-author of   tells TODAY.com. “I think eggs are definitely a safe bet when you’re at an airport.” Eggs contain protein, vitamins, antioxidants and healthy fats,  . They haven’t been shown to raise cholesterol in a lot of people, Eisenberg adds. But he urges travelers to skip any butter, which he calls one of “the worst foods,” and watch their salt intake. The coffee chain usually has oatmeal available, which is a  , Freeman notes. He also likes to order beverages without dairy products or added sweeteners; a bagel that can be topped with hummus or guacamole; or a plant-based protein box with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Starbucks also often has a basket of bananas, which are extremely nutritious and healthy because of their fiber and potassium, Cheng adds. Cheng might pick up a small bag of nuts, a fruit-and-nut bar or a small container of yogurt. Yogurt is good for the  , but it’s important to watch the sugar content, she advises. These stores also often have fresh fruit, fruit cups or salads, Freeman adds. “Most airports have a Mexican option, and the truth is you can almost always get tacos or a rice bowl, typically with things like brown rice, vegetables and beans and salsa, without the meat and cheese and sour cream pretty easily,” Freeman says. Most airports also have a steakhouse, but travelers don’t have to stick to the menu. “Tell them that you want a plain baked potato and green beans without the butter,” Freeman advises. “They might look at you strange, but it’s actually a surprisingly easy thing for them to do for you.” Hamburgers, fries and other foods full of saturated fat, salt, cholesterol, carbs or sugar top the list. A Cinnabon Classic Roll has 880 calories, according to the company. Pizza, however, is probably a better option than a hamburger at one of the fast-food places, Eisenberg says. “When you take a salad and you put beef, pork or chicken and ranch dressing and all these things that people like to put on their salads, it very quickly turns it right into a double cheeseburger,” Freeman cautions. “Many times, a salad, when It’s prepared in the usual American way, can have more calories, saturated fat and cholesterol than the cheeseburger itself.” Freeman is always wary of the options in a vending machine: “I tell my patients: The longer the shelf life, the shorter your life.” In general, one or two days of eating bad food — if that’s the only option available — is unlikely to hurt most healthy people, though travelers with heart failure, high blood pressure or diabetes have to be more careful, Eisenberg says. But there’s a difference between what people do on a daily basis and what they do at specific times, like traveling during Thanksgiving, he   adds. If you’re stuck at the airport, perhaps with kids, and you need something to temper the mood and buy some patience and time, you do what you need to, Cheng adds. “But in general, I would recommend patients stick to what they know is good for their health,” she advises.

Fairchild had a recurring role as the mother of Perry’s Chandler Bing on “Friends,” beginning in the first season and lasting through the show’s eighth season. She said taking the part marked a shift in her own career. “I just always remember Matthew, when I first met him, because when they offered me the part, I had only played mothers of teenagers. Suddenly they’re offering me to play the mother of a grown guy,” she told TODAY on Nov. 22 while appearing with Nicollette Sheridan and Donna Mills, her co-stars in the upcoming Lifetime movie “Ladies of the ‘80s: A Divas Christmas.” “I remember Cicely Tyson saying to me, ‘You’re too young to play that guy’s mom.’ I thought the show had potential. It wasn’t a big hit yet. And I was right.” Fairchild said her first encounter with Perry on the show took her on a trip down memory lane, since she had appeared on the ‘80s primetime soap opera “Falcon Crest,” alongside his father, actor John Bennett Perry. She said Matthew Perry told her that he used to spend time on that set, as well as the set of an earlier series she was on called “Flamingo Road.” “So I took the part and then the first day on the set (of 'Friends'), Matthew comes bounding over to me, the big puppy dog energy that he always had and said, ‘You won’t remember me, but I used to hang out on the “Flamingo Road” and “Falcon Crest” set with you,’” she recalled. “I said, 'You did?’ (He said) 'John Bennett Perry’s my father,'"" Fairchild said. ""And I said, ‘That little kid was you? I guess I am old enough to play your mom,'"" she said.  Fairchild said Perry did a great job connecting with audiences by playing the sarcastic Chandler, while she also reached many fans. “He was just so lovely and I was so touched because a lot of the world thought of me as Chandler’s mom,” she said.  “And so I was receiving a lot of the condolences, too, and it was very touching to see how many lives that he touched that people felt he was their friend and identified with him and the stories about ‘He got me, that character got me through rough times in my life.’ He left a lasting legacy.” Perry   last month at 54 from an apparent drowning.

https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/80-20-rule-diet-rcna40951,Is the 80/20 rule healthy? The pros and cons of the diet plan,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The 80/20 rule is simple. Eat nutritious, healthy foods 80% of the time and enjoy foods considered less healthy 20% of the time. It's a more flexible approach to eating, which encourages a balanced diet and indulging in moderation rather than restrictive dieting. Whether your goal is  ,  , or preventing disease — changing your diet is no easy task. Committing to making healthy choices every single meal, every single day, can be daunting. But it's not necessary, according to the 80/20 philosophy. The 80/20 plan is about consistency. It's rooted in the idea that what you do   of the time has the greatest impact. It's more of a real-life approach to healthy eating — because real life involves treating yourself, sometimes with a cherry on top.  If you don't want to deprive yourself of your favorite treats and like the idea of enjoying junk food or sweets every now and then while maintaining a nutritious diet, the 80/20 plan might be a good option. Here’s how it works and how to determine if it’s the right fit for you. Most of the time, you’ll be filling your plate with whole foods. It’s healthiest to load about ¾ of your plate with  , such as vegetables, fruit, nuts,  ,  , whole grains and  .  That leaves a quarter of your plate for animal foods, which usually represent the protein portion of the plate. (Of course, you can also   if you’d like.) Healthy animal-based options include Greek yogurt,  , eggs, seafood, poultry and grass-fed beef. Here’s an example of the types of meals you’d eat 80% of the time. Since you’re fueling your body with the nutrition it needs most of the time, the rest of the time is the eater’s choice. That means you can have some ice cream after dinner one day and a slice of pizza for lunch the next day. This approach can be helpful because when less healthful foods are deemed off-limits, you may be more likely to  . Not only that, but it’s stressful to try to avoid your favorite foods. Let’s say you love French fries. Every time you see them in a restaurant, on TV or while scrolling Instagram, your brain must work overtime to consciously avoid them. Eventually, this mental workout becomes too exhausting to maintain, priming you to throw in the towel and just eat the darned fries. So, with the 80/20 diet, you may be able to avoid mental gymnastics by   since you’re eating nutritious foods the majority of the time. Since there aren’t any official rules, people structure the 80/20 plan differently, and certain approaches may be unhelpful. For instance, some people choose to eat a little dessert each night, others prefer a   here and there, and some stick with healthy foods during the week and less healthy ones over the weekend. As a registered dietitian, I’d caution against the last approach. Taking the   off plays into the on/off mentality — that you’re ‘good’ during the week and ‘bad’ on weekends. This can backfire in a couple of ways. First, you may be unnecessarily limiting your food choices — and therefore, your enjoyment — during the week. Being satisfied with your food choices helps you sustain them, and that means you’ll maintain the benefits they provide. Think: Better energy during the day and  , improvements in mental well-being, healthier  , and a lower risk of numerous illnesses. You’ll also avoid the sluggishness and other   that accompany a full day (or two) of less healthful eating. Next, going ‘off’ plan on the weekend is comparable to a  . The word ‘cheat’ implies that you’re behaving in an  inappropriate way, which can affect your mental health. The truth is, your health isn’t just about what you’re eating; it’s also about how you frame your inner conversations about food (in addition to other factors, like getting adequate sleep and exercise). So, when you use words like ‘cheat’ or ‘bad,’ you’re talking to yourself in a way that could promote guilt and shame around food, resulting in an unhealthy relationship with food. Indeed, the emphasis on eating well most of the time is in line with what registered dietitians and other qualified health professionals recommend. Nothing is off limits, so you can eat the less healthy foods you love within reason — up to 20% of the time. Plus, there’s no tracking or counting of any kind, and these habits, while helpful, can also be triggering or overwhelming to some people. Finally, the 80/20 diet can be adapted to whatever eating pattern you prefer, be it  , vegan,   or anything else. The flexibility of the diet is both a pro and a con. Without much structure or guidance, you’re in the decision-making driver’s seat about what to eat. Add to that the fact that you’re not just making food decisions during the day; you may also be making work, school or family decisions, and the reality is that all of this drains your mental energy. This is known as decision fatigue, and   it can result in less self-control. Here’s how this can play out: You hit a decision-making wall and don’t want to think about what to make for dinner, how to balance your plate, or whether you’ve gone above the 20% window. So, to make things easier for yourself, you log into Uber Eats and choose what looks good, which may be a less healthy choice. Since 20% of your diet can come from less healthy foods, this may be appropriate, but if you do it too often or if it makes you feel out of control and guilty afterward, it can interfere with your physical or mental health. And as stated earlier, if you’re thinking of the 20% relaxed eating period as a cheat meal or day, it can also deter from your mental well-being. Also, the 80/20 plan doesn’t address   you may make less healthy choices. For instance, if you   or bored, the plan won’t teach you how to cope with these emotions. Additionally, the 80/20 diet doesn’t offer information about other supportive tools, such as learning to  , but not ravenous, and when you’re comfortable, but not stuffed. The reality is that good health involves a series of behaviors — including  , stress management and   — that go beyond your eating habits. But nutritious eating is a strong foundation, and if the 80/20 diet helps you eat better without creating stress or guilt, you’ll benefit from the plan. , MS, RD, is a nutrition and wellness expert, author and columnist.

At least the question ""When does Elf on the Shelf start?"" has a correct answer. According to the official Elf on the Shelf site,   begins Nov. 22 and lasts until Dec. 1. But how did the Elf become such a huge part of Christmas culture?  (Hint: The TODAY Show played a small part in sparking the holiday magic!) Carol Aebersold received an adorable pixie elf named Fisbee when she was a child, and in 1974, she told her three children that Fisbee's job was to keep an eye on them during the day and report their behavior to Santa Claus at night. The tradition was so beloved that Aebersold and her daughters, Chanda Bell and Christa Pitts, turned it into a book and figurine in 2005. Every publisher and editor they approached turned them down, so the family ended up self-publishing.  “I was a new mom myself, and I was like, ‘Hey, Mom, I need an elf that talks to Santa too! There was nothing like that available,” Bell told   in 2015. The simple story says: ""Each night while you’re sleeping/to Santa I’ll fly. I’ll tell him if you have been good or bad. The news of the day makes him happy or sad … I’ll be back at your home before you awake, and then you must find the new spot I will take.” The family was selling their gift package to customers one at a time, then in 2007,   was photographed carrying an Elf on the Shelf package. Shortly after, the TODAY Show aired a segment about the toy, which led to a deluge of orders. “PayPal shut down our website because of the surge in traffic,” Bell told   in 2016. The rest is Christmas history. The year 2012 was pivotal year for the company: The animated special ""An Elf’s Story"" premiered, as did the Elf on the Shelf balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. At the time, it was the largest balloon in the parade. In December 2022, Pitts told   that more than 22.5 million elves have been sold.  If you need to brush up on the Elf rules and regulations before the start of the season, here are the  : Using these rules as a guide, you can get as creative as you'd like. The company has an app to help guide parents through the Elf-ing process, and social media is packed with parents sharing and showing off their cleverly designed Elf scenes.

https://www.today.com/health/what-turkey-makes-you-sleepy-truth-about-tryptophan-t142417,Why does turkey make you sleepy? The truth about tryptophan,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Tryptophan in turkey has become almost as famous as the bird's  . So has the legend of its power to make people sleepy. But does   turkey actually induce drowsiness? ""No more so than tuna fish. It's a myth,"" Dr. Marc Eisenberg, a clinical cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, tells TODAY.com. ""People are sleepy after Thanksgiving because of all the other stuff including the alcohol and just eating too much food."" Still, the myth persists. NBC News Health and Nutrition Editor Madelyn Fernstrom suspects it really took off after a 1997 “Seinfeld” episode that featured Jerry and George scheming to make a woman fall asleep so they could play with her antique toy collection. After they treat her to a big turkey dinner, complete with a box of red wine and lots of heavy gravy, she’s soon snoozing on the couch. Trytophan is specifically mentioned by the characters as “that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy.” But that’s not quite accurate.  is one of the  , which the body uses to make proteins to help it grow and repair tissue, according to the National Library of Medicine. The body can’t produce tryptophan, so you must get it from your diet, it notes. Turkey is a good source, but so is cheese, chicken, fish, milk, peanuts, egg whites and soy beans. Tryptophan can also be found in sunflower,   and sesame seeds. Amino acids do more than just build muscle — some of them are the “starter” compounds for brain neurotransmitters, Fernstrom says. “Tryptophan can become   — the brain chemical that calms, causes sleep, among other things — if the right enzymes are around to do so,” she notes. The body also uses tryptophan to make melatonin, which helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle, according to the National Library of Medicine. Eating more tryptophan in high-protein foods like   does increase the tryptophan going into your bloodstream, but that doesn’t mean your body will turn it into serotonin. Other amino acids are competing with tryptophan to get into the brain using the same entry “door” and because there are many more of these other compounds than tryptophan, there‘s no impact on serotonin levels with a   meal like roast turkey, Fernstrom says. You’d have more success if you were to eat just mashed potatoes or rolls at Thanksgiving dinner: The way to get more tryptophan into the brain and boost serotonin production is by eating pure carbohydrate, she explains. That releases insulin, which lowers the levels of other amino acids, so tryptophan has a chance to get in to the brain without competition. Many people do get very drowsy after consuming a huge Thanksgiving meal. The average dinner can contain 3,000 calories, according to the Calorie Control Council. Don’t blame the turkey for making you sleepy, though. “That’s due to changes in metabolic activity during digestion. The body has signals to ‘slow down’ and digest the food as a priority,” Fernstrom says. “And there are changes in glucose and insulin balance that can impact the brain and the digestive system.” Add the stress of hosting or attending a Thanksgiving dinner, the lack of sleep during  , free-flowing alcohol and all the sitting around in front of the TV afterward, and you have the perfect formula for dozing off. The best solution to stay more alert is to moderate your meal.   making plant-based side dishes as the main dish instead of eating a huge portion of turkey. They also advise skipping turkey skin, butter and gravy. And don’t overdo it on the wine. Stick to one or two drinks, or avoid alcohol altogether. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

https://www.today.com/parents/5-uncomfortable-questions-thanksgiving-dinner-table-t119056,Rude! How to respond to 5 parent-judging comments at the Thanksgiving table,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands As a parent, Thanksgiving can be a great time to get together with loved ones and show off your little people and how much they have grown ... until someone knocks over one of Uncle Jerry's tchotchkes and he goes all law-and-order on your 4-year-old. Before you head over the river and through the woods, we have some tips from experts on how to handle those rude and uncomfortable comments and questions from your own personal peanut galleries. Who knew people had such strong opinions about how a child eats? Child development expert   told TODAY.com that one way to respond to such concerns is to act like the person asking the question is   about your child's welfare. ""With no sarcasm whatsoever, ask, 'What concerns you about it?'"" Gilboa suggested. ""Throw it back on them, but be really respectful at the same time. Say, 'I believe you love my kid, and you're worried ... so why exactly are you worried?'"" Gilboa said parents should also feel free to ""throw an expert under the bus"" when responding to questions. ""You can say, 'My doctor said this was the healthiest option for my baby,' or you can cite the World Health Organization guidelines,"" she said. If all else fails, you can always rely on (slightly snarky) humor with an answer that makes it clear you are answering the question but not inviting a conversation or debate about it, said Gilboa, who is the mother of four boys. ""Parenting is hard. You can give yourself a laugh,"" she said. ""Something like, 'I read breastfeeding makes up for all my late-night drinking.'"" ""That answer might make you feel better, but it won't necessarily make Thanksgiving better for everyone,"" warned Gilboa. Your first response might be to burst into tears or use sarcasm — ""Do you really want to talk about my sex life? Because I don't"" — depending on your situation. Gilboa said this is an opportunity to take the high road and respond in a way that shuts the commenter down respectfully. ""Go with a heartfelt response, like, 'A lot goes into making a family, and we're doing the best we know how,'"" she suggested. You can choose to respond very directly and cut to the true point of an invasive question without losing your cool, Gilboa said. ""Try, 'I appreciate your interest, but I don't want to talk about our family planning in this setting,'"" she suggested. ""Remember, you do not have to actually answer the question itself."" Any adult who believes hitting a child is the right way to change behavior won't be interested in hearing an explanation of why the child might be behaving badly, said Gilboa. You have a few options: You can ignore the comment altogether and lead little Bobby to a different, less threatening area of the house. You can try acknowledging the behavior without actually addressing the comment itself — ""You're right, he is really unpleasant to be around right now"" — and then walk away. Or, said Dr. Gilboa, you can do a combination of responding respectfully and citing experts. ""'I totally wish I could (spank him), but I’ve been told by expert after expert that spanking actually makes behavior worse,'"" she suggested. You can also take the tack of commenting without really agreeing, she said, by responding with something like, ""Ah, my dad would have said the same thing."" Here, Gilboa said, you could call the person out on the statement. ""'My mom says the same thing about my little brother, but I remember differently,'"" she suggested. Or even, ""Babies were so much more advanced before we had cell phone cameras and videos!"" This is also a situation when you could respond assuming real concern. With a furrowed brow but no hint of sarcasm, you can ask the relative, ""Are you really worried he's delayed? Are you saying you think I should get him checked?"" ""Let them reassure you that's not what they meant,"" advised Gilboa. Ask any teenager what they are dreading most about the upcoming holiday, and this will probably be the answer. ""Adults expect us to have, like, a  ,"" a high school senior told TODAY Parents, spreading her hands out wide. ""I don't have a plan!"" , author of ""Enough As She Is: How to Help Girls Move Beyond Impossible Standards of Success to Live Healthy, Happy, and Fulfilling Lives,"" told TODAY.com that this uncomfortable question gives parents a valuable chance to talk about boundary-setting with their teenagers. ""Every kid needs to know that it's OK to set a boundary, and it can be done politely, so this could be a great opportunity for parents to model and coach it for their teenagers,"" said Simmons. Simmons recommended making sure teenagers have a response prepared — and perhaps even practice by role-playing with a parent — before they hit the stage that is a holiday dinner table. ""Have a plan for what to say,"" she advised. She recommends beginning with a deflecting comment — something like, ""It's such an overwhelming topic. It's a holiday! Do we have to talk about such serious things?"" Then, it's easy to change the subject to one that takes the spotlight off the teen, said Simmons. Simmons also said it's important to teach teens that they can always say, kindly but firmly, ""This isn't something I want to talk about right now."" ""Kids don't often have the opportunity to practice this skill with adults,"" said Simmons. ""The ability to say no in a way that doesn’t put someone off is a skill that a young person will need, if not in college, right afterwards in the workforce,"" she said. ""It's a critical skill."" Gilboa said this is a skill for parents as well; dealing with nosy or judgmental relatives at the holidays might not be fun, but it can be useful. ""Children get pushed to answer questions they don't want to all the time,"" she noted. ""This gives us a chance to show them how to handle ugly peer pressure. And if we handle it well, it gives us credibility with our kids,"" she said. And when your seat at the dinner table gets hot, Gilboa said it's important to try to keep your sense of humor ... or remove yourself from the situation. ""It's great if you can have a side bet going with your parenting partner or another friend as to who will get a judgy or snarky comment first,"" she said. ""You can always sneak off to watch YouTube videos of your happy place, or offer to go to the grocery store for more food or wine!"" © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Cuoco confesses there are days where she’d rather cuddle with her partner, Tom Pelphrey, and  , than exercise.  “But then I remind myself that it’s just an hour of my day, and like eating, it’s important for my body and my heart,” Cuoco explains. “And you never leave a workout and go, ‘I wish I didn’t do that.’ Even if it wasn’t the workout you envisioned, even if it it was a little bit more low-key. Getting a good sweat sets the whole tone for the day.” Cuoco opened up to TODAY.com while promoting her partnership with Brooks Running, a company she says ""saved"" her throbbing feet.  “I   and my feet started hurting aggressively. I would go to bed crying at night. And my partner, Tom, has been wearing Brooks for years, and he was like, ‘Dude, you need to get on the Brooks train,’” Cuoco says. “Well, I bought my first pair and it was a game changer. Now it’s all I wear."" At the moment, Cuoco is loving the brand’s Ghost Max series. “I train in them, I walk the dog in them,” she says. “I also feel like nowadays, sneakers are so freaking cool — you wear them with a dress and look as cute as can be. I don’t even own heels anymore.” Though Cuoco and Pelphrey both work out in Brooks, you won’t find them working out together.  “We like very different things. He does a lot of lifting. He does a ton of pull-ups and I can’t even do a single one,” she says. “That’s our hour to ourselves!”  Rachel Paula Abrahamson is a lifestyle reporter who writes for the parenting, health and shop verticals.

Whether you're waiting for the turkey to finish cooking or the , there are some Thanksgiving traditions that are a must.  This year, the holiday falls on Thursday, Nov. 23. It's slowly becoming time to gather   and  , and exchange gratefulness declarations or    It's also becoming time to collect a few pop culture recommendations, too. To help set the atmosphere with Thanksgiving cheer, TODAY.com has rounded up some of the best movies for the holiday.  Queue up some animated classics like ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,"" PG   like ""The Mighty Ducks,"" movies on Disney+ (a  of them), and all that Netflix has to offer.  There are classics, like ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" and hidden gems, like ""Dutch,"" that some consider the ultimate Thanksgiving movie.  And most of all, there's something for you.  Thanksgiving is about gathering. But what if you don't like the people you're gathered next to? ""Grumpy Old Men"" is a classic starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as two Minnesota neighbors who never got along and never will (they think). During the Thanksgiving season, turkeys take the spotlight. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" turns our attention to other woodland creatures — the wily fox. Wes Anderson directs this lively, star-studded animated movie adapted from a Roald Dahl novel. Vivica A. Fox, Vanessa Williams and Nia Long star as estranged sisters who reunite to spend time with their mother, Big Mama, who falls into a coma. She was the glue holding the family together, so her absence nearly brings the family to blows before they figure out how to get along. Al Pacino earned an Oscar for his role as an irascible, blind retired Army lieutenant colonel. There is a Thanksgiving scene, yes, but it's worth watching just for its cinematic appeal. ""For Your Consideration"" is all about a fictional film as it vies for Oscar nominations. At some point it's retitled ""Home for Thanksgiving"" to help its Oscar chances, or so the cast and crew think. ""An Old-Fashioned Thanksgiving"" is loosely based on a short story by Louisa May Alcott in which a widow, Mary Bassett (played by Helene Joy), cannot afford to have a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner with her three kids. Her wealthy mother, whom Mary cannot stand, catches wind of it and arrives at Mary's home to help, which Mary resents. Lauren is finally ready to share her sexuality with her family by introducing her partner to them on Thanksgiving. But every time she tries to, there's some type of distraction that thwarts her efforts. April Burns (Katie Holmes) invites her family to spend Thanksgiving with her in her tiny New York City apartment. They are physically so close to each other, but couldn't be further away emotionally and socially. Sixty-something-year-old Krisha has become sober after a history of addiction and wishes to reconnect with her family, with whom she has an estranged relationship. She arrives at her sister's house where everyone is staying in hopes of winning them over.  It's one tumultuous year for the characters in ""Stuck In Love,"" but somehow an estranged family finds a place of peace after it all. Three generations of Blakes spend Thanksgiving in lower Manhattan. There's more tension than turkey, though, and a lot of familial fractures that they must work through before they can actually enjoy each other's company. ""Our Father's Keeper"" pulls on the heartstrings in showing arguing family members who attempt to care for their patriarch as he forgets who they are. It's really not Thanksgiving without some drama, and ""Tower Heist"" is just that when a ragtag group of unlikely friends try to take back stolen money from a con man. Dutch Dooley (Ed O'Neill) volunteers to pick up his new girlfriend's son from school in another state. Little does he know, he has a new formidable foe in the form of a preteen. ""Dutch"" is a story about dysfunction that can come with blending families  the awe-inspiring power of a brat.  Life gets put into perspective in ""Funny People""   after heralded comedian George Simmons (Adam Sandler) learns he has a fatal disease. To preserve his legacy, he starts imparting all his tricks of the trade to struggling performer Ira (Seth Rogen). The experience breathes new life into Simmons — literally and figuratively. Dark humor is on full display in ""The Oath,"" a comedy starring Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz in which a dystopian government makes Thanksgiving Day a deadline to declare loyalty or face consequences. ""Alice's Restaurant"" is a dramatic comedy starring folk singer Arlo Guthrie  Arlo Guthrie. Guthrie plays a college student who has avoided being drafted into the military. He's fresh off leaving college and having a Friendsgiving when a simple mistake gets him on the police's radar. ""Friendsgiving"" has surprises in the form of unexpected houseguests, unwanted changes in events and a resurfacing of problems previously solved. The ensemble film stars Malin Åkerman, Kat Dennings, Aisha Tyler, Chelsea Peretti, Christine Taylor, Jane Seymour, Wanda Sykes and Deon Cole.  ""The Turkey Bowl"" is a sports comedy in which rival high school football teams in a rural community hash out old beef in a rematch of their classic football tournament, the eponymous Turkey Bowl. The game will settle 15 years of unfinished business, but the stakes become even higher than that as the movie unfolds. ""Sweet November"" is a remake of a 1968 film of the same name. There are endless   — but here's a Thanksgiving one. In the 30 days of November, Charlize Theron's character goes through a short-lived, but deep, romance with Keanu Reeves.  This dramatic rom-com will tug at the heartstrings. In the movie, a notorious playboy falls in love with a young woman facing a fatal illness. ""Autumn in New York"" stars Richard Gere, Winona Ryder and Anthony LaPaglia. ""Instant Family"" is the quintessential example of how Thanksgiving dinners can be full of pressing questions no one wants to answer. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne play new parents who adopt three siblings after years of saying they'd never have children. But becoming an ""instant family"" isn't easy. It doesn't get any more on brand than this holiday classic, ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" from 1973. Peppermint Patty invites everyone over to Charlie Brown's for Thanksgiving for an iconic scene of them all sitting around the table together to eat a rather untraditional meal. In ""Home for the Holidays,"" Holly Hunter plays Claudia Larson, a middle-aged mother whose daughter makes Thanksgiving plans without her. Left alone, Larson returns to her childhood home with her dysfunctional family who gets on her nerves, but she ends up remembering the importance of family — and finding a new love.  In ""Garfield's Thanksgiving,"" the titular cat's owner puts him on a diet right before Thanksgiving. Of course, Garfield isn't having that, so he cooks up ways to still get the food portions he's usually spoiled with. Nothing washes down turkey like a   to rally behind. Tom Hanks stars alongside Meg Ryan as two New Yorkers who meet online without knowing they are actually business rivals in real life. Watching NFL games on Thanksgiving Day is a tradition for many. When the games end, start your own overtime with ""Hoosiers,""   of a high school basketball team in Indiana and its unlikely rise. After watching ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,"" you may be nostalgic for more Peanuts action. ""The Peanuts Movie"" is a newer spin on the characters, starring Noah Schnapp of ""Stranger Things"" as Charlie Brown. In ""The Mighty Ducks,"" a disgruntled lawyer is ordered to perform community service and ends up coaching a kids hockey team. By the end, the job hardly feels like work.  Thanksgiving is all about coming together — and when that happens, drama occasionally follows. The latest ""Little Women"" adaptation is the definition of cozy, with the four March sisters (Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen) helping each other through loves and disappointments in Massachusetts during the Civil War era. Thanks to some holiday magic, Claudia (Daphne Zuniga) has a chance to see what her life could look like with a few tweaks. In the Hallmark movie, Claudia goes from high-powered lawyer looking for a promotion to a wife and mother trying to cope with her new responsibilities. Is there a place she can meet in the middle?  Or, just make it a ""Toy Story"" marathon. ""Toy Story 4"" is the most recent sequel in the series of beloved Pixar movies about sentient toys whose owners severely underestimate their capacity for adventure. Warning: You  cry. ""Free Birds"" is a Thanksgiving caper told from a turkey's point of view. In the movie, a turkey named Reggie (Owen Wilson) is pardoned by the president to live life without fear of being eaten for Thanksgiving. He partners with Jake (Woody Harrelson), another turkey, to travel back in time to 1621, before the first Thanksgiving, to stop the bird from becoming the holiday's trademark dish.  Nothing says Thanksgiving like good eating! ""Ratatouille,"" a Paris-set Pixar movie, is a celebration of just that. Remy is an aspiring chef ... who also happens to be a rat. He tries to climb the culinary ladder, despite encountering skepticism from every angle.  Thanksgiving is a holiday centered around an American story – and ""National Treasure"" is the story of one very famous American document. Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is on the hunt for a treasure only rumored to exist and in his pursuit discovers a string of clues located on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Every Thanksgiving has a little Christmas sprinkled into it. ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" is a good segue movie for celebrating both occasions. Paul Blart (Kevin James) is routinely ridiculed for taking his job as a security guard at the mall too seriously. But when he's the only one left to save shoppers from a mall's Santa's helpers gone rogue, everyone relies on him. This fun film is great for pre-turkey laughs while dinner is still cooking. ""Addams Family Values"" is a sequel to the 1991 ""Addams Family"" film starring Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia and Christina Ricci. How Thanksgiving is done in small towns is very different from how it's celebrated in big cities. ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" shows four dinosaur friends leaving their small city for an adventure in the Big Apple that even they aren't quite big enough to handle.  Imagine if one of the many Santas-for-hire in the United States was actually the real deal? Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) is convinced that the jovial man (Edmund Gwenn) she meets at a Macy's might really be Santa, and tries to convince the world to believe her. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without unpredictable weather, specifically in the Midwestern region. Unfortunately, Neal Page (Steve Martin) in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" may miss his Thanksgiving plans after his flight to Chicago is rerouted to Kansas. He hits every road block imaginable when trying to make it home, and learns a lot along the way. This hourlong Winnie the Pooh special tells three stories: “Groundpiglet Day,” “A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving” and “Find Her, Keep Her.”  ""A Looney Tunes Thanksgiving"" serves up two segments, ""Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving Diet"" and ""Daffy Duck's Thanks-for-giving Special."" They take an unconventional approach to a traditional holiday, but it works. And last but not least in TODAY's Thanksgiving movie pack is ""Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow."" Tag along as the Emmerson family tries to track down an elusive monster some don't even believe exist. Randi Richardson is a reporter for NBC News' TODAY.com based in Brooklyn. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

It can be hearty with little meatballs or shellfish. It can be dressed up as a vegetarian dish with cheese and mushrooms or roasted root vegetables. The sauce and gnocchi can be made in advance and warmed together when ready to serve. The cheeses have the perfect amount of richness and tanginess. I have served this dish alongside a steak and a platter of vegetables. No matter how much I make, I could have always made more. You can also add a dot of blue cheese at the end to give it that four-cheese pizza vibe if you like something more dramatic. I love this dish because it can stand on its own or complement any other dish. This is a dessert that everyone loves because it's just so American. I love this dessert because it's completely make-ahead and beyond tasty. It belongs anywhere: the Thanksgiving pie table, the holiday cookie party — it's a showstopper. I love the taste of the homemade whipped cream here with not too much sugar. The dessert can get overly sweet, and this recipe rides that line with great balance. I have served this with an over-the-top addition of hot fudge on the side. You can add some toppings for added texture. You can lightly freeze and serve even colder. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

At this point, your guest list should be solidified, your shopping should be done and your  . What else can you do to set yourself up for success before the big day? You can prep ahead. , aka the Barefoot Contessa, is here to answer your burning, last-minute Thanksgiving questions so that you can go into tomorrow with confidence rather than concern. From the best way to avoid dry turkey to her absolute favorite Thanksgiving dish (which can be made ahead!), Garten is sharing her tips and recipes to keep Turkey Day easy and simple. And remember, even on Thanksgiving,  . “My  , of course,” says Garten. “Wet brine  , dry brine  ” she says. “Brining makes me crazy because a wet brine takes us so much shelf space. I believe in a dry brine. Salt, thyme, lemon zest, and you just rub it into the turkey and let that sit for a day or two.” “Not only is this the best way to keep the turkey moist but it’s easy to make ahead,” says Garten. “I roast the turkey early in the day and then take an ovenproof platter, fill the bottom of it with gravy, slice turkey on it and set it aside. About 30 minutes before I’m ready to serve, I put it in the oven. Because the gravy is on the bottom of the platter, it keeps it hot!” “I love to look around where I am — the local specialty shop for mashed potatoes or another side that I know is going to be good and I work around that. Look to your local bakery for a pie,” says Garten. “But if you want to make your own — when you’re at the grocery store, buy items that give you a head start on those side dishes to help save you time in the kitchen,” she continues. “Pre-cut anything is the way to go because of the time it’ll save you. Like butternut squash — buy a pre-cut package or even frozen sweet potatoes and roast that with your own kind of seasoning. When it comes to stuffing, instead of toasting the bread yourself, buy stuffing mix and go from there. “If you’re making mashed potatoes, start with premade mashed potatoes and make  . It’s really simple:  You add your own sour cream Parmesan and butter, and finish with salt and pepper. Your guests will never know they weren’t made from scratch, and it takes five minutes.” “Sometimes I feel like store-bought pie crusts are the best way to go,” says Garten. “Most people find making pie crust daunting. There are a few secrets that will change all that. First, the butter, shortening and water must all be very cold. Second, let the dough sit in the refrigerator (bakers call it “relaxing” the dough) for 30 minutes before rolling, and finally, don’t stretch the dough when you’re placing it into the pan.” “You want to use a metal pie pan because it’ll brown better than a glass one,” she advises. “I like to do a buffet with all the food and put condiments on the table,” says Garten. “I like to make a mushroom and leek bread pudding instead of stuffing,” she says. “A turkey with stuffing needs to cook longer than a plain turkey so you end up with dry turkey and soggy stuffing. I prefer to roast a turkey like I roast a chicken, with just onion, lemon and thyme in the cavity. Instead of stuffing, I make a savory bread pudding with mushrooms, leeks and rich Gruyère cheese to go with the turkey. It’s crusty on top and moist inside. Make this in advance and reheat it while the turkey rests. Emi Boscamp is the senior food editor at TODAY. She was born without a sweet tooth, but in its place she has an umami tooth.

Last year, some of the hottest (and hardest to score) toys included the   and Squishmallows plushies. But you don't have to wait until the holiday season to catch a glimpse of what the most popular   will be. Laurie Schacht, Chief Toy Officer at The Toy Insider, previously stopped by the   to give us a sneak peak of the toys she predicts will be at the top of everyone's wish list this holiday season. Plus, many retailers like  ,   and   released their own hot toy lists that are filled with exciting new picks. From Barbie's Dreamhouse to a real cotton candy maker, these toys are trendy and packed with fun. Keep reading to see the hottest toys of 2023.       Even though this pick is digital, your kiddo will still be able to touch and feel this hot holiday toy. As your little one swipes, tilts, shakes and touches this little pet, it will grow from a baby to an adult. It will be love at first pet! This isn’t your average remote control car! While kids can send it zooming across floors like they would a regular race car, they can also extend their range and drive it up the walls or even on the ceiling. Remember Furby? Well, the little creature is back! This new version responds to five commands — dance party, copy cat, tell my fortune, let’s chill and light show — and it reacts to petting it on the head and giving it a hug. Trying to choose between your kid’s current obsessions — cars and dinosaurs — can be tough. But with this toy, they’ll get a little bit of everything that they love. The hauler can carry around more than 20 Hot Wheels cars and then transform into a stomping T-Rex with a race track on its back! They can also send cars flying out of its mouth as it lights up and makes sounds.  We’ve seen this cute robot dog pop up on a few different toy lists this season. The dog goes through a “minting process” as soon as you open the box — it takes on personality traits and displays colorful lights and sounds that are completely unique, so no dog is the same. You can even create different profiles on the corresponding app, so every member of the family can have their own pup with a different personality! Millions of these brain teaser puzzles have been sold, thanks to word of mouth and social media, with adults and children alike trying to solve the hundreds of puzzles within.  This toy is perfect for   over the holidays or for keeping children occupied during travel, due to its compact size and ability to fit in carry-ons and backpacks.  Rated as one of the best and most popular toys for   and those learning to walk, this balance bicycle is loved by parents because it's ""sturdy,"" ""durable"" and they adore the color scheme, as this bike is available in 10 different colorways.  Schacht's next pick is the newest Barbie Dreamhouse. Made with pet lovers in mind, the Dreamhouse includes a puppy slide and pool, pet elevator and pet palace complete with a puppy figure, pet bed and doggie door. It also includes more than 75 accessories and the tallest slide in the Barbie Dreamhouse ever. This doll is one of more than 30 Barbie Fashionistas. The doll line is designed ""to reflect the world kids see today."" They all wear bright and trendy styles. Keeping on the  trend, Schacht thinks Barbie's 1956 Corvette Stingray will be a hot toy this holiday season. The ride can hold two Barbie dolls and has room in the trunk for Barbie's favorite accessories. After the car is all loaded, use the remote control to speed up to five miles per hour. Schacht's next pick is for kiddos and parents who love no mess, no noise toys. With crafts ranging from beginner to master, the mini pottery studio includes 10 projects for your little one to tackle. By the time snow starts falling to the ground, popsicles and ice cream will have fallen out of style.

The Fox Sports broadcaster opened up to Hoda Kotb in the newest episode of   about the 2008 incident that landed stalker Michael David Barrett in prison and resulted in Andrews, 45, living with post-traumatic stress.  TODAY.com shared an excerpt from the interview on Nov. 20, and it will be released in full on Wednesday.    several times through a peephole while she was naked in her room at a Nashville hotel in 2008. Barrett also filmed Andrews at a hotel in Columbus, Ohio, and the videos were put online in 2009.  ""People thought it was a scandal, and I’m the square from high school,"" Andrews told Hoda.  ""I don’t do those things. I knew the second I got the phone call from my friend at Sports Illustrated that he said, there’s this video. And I said, 'No, there’s not. I don’t do that. I’m single. I don’t have that going on in my life.' He's like, 'Erin, it's you.'""  Andrews said she made an anguished phone call to her parents after watching the video.   ""My dad says he thought I had been in a car accident because I was just screaming,"" Andrews said. ""And I feel so bad. My parents were incredible. I was, God, in my thirties when that happened, and I resorted to acting like a 15-year-old because, in terms of not wanting to deal, my parents really, they were on the forefront.""  Barrett,   to altering the peepholes, served 2½ years in prison for interstate stalking and was released in 2012.  Four years later, Andrews   against Barrett and the companies that managed the Nashville Marriott hotel where the videos were filmed.  “I know I still need to go into therapy for it and deal with the PTSD even at this level,” Andrews said. “I’m doing a lot better.”  The support of her parents was crucial, which included putting together a legal team and working with the FBI.  “That is where most of my pain comes from is that my poor parents had to deal with that,” Andrews said. “It brought on a lot of stress. My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer right after my trial, which, don’t tell me that that’s not a coincidence.”  Andrews said she and her sister found anxiety medication at their parents’ home in the midst of the ordeal.  “And she’s like, ‘Well, they had taken them ever since your trial,’” Andrews said. “And I was like, ‘Oh God.’ You just feel so bad, but that’s what great parents do. They take the weight, they take the brunt of it for their kid. And my parents are amazing.”  These days, Andrews said she feels more relaxed when walking around NFL stadiums and having people asking to take pictures with her, compared to the anxiety of the aftermath of the stalking incident.  “I like feeling that way versus I used to walk in the stadiums where there’s 70, 80, 000 people, and I thought every single one of these people have seen me naked,” Andrews said. “And I was like, ‘When am I going to stop feeling like that?’ “I used to make jokes about it to coaches or players (like) well, I know you’ve seen. It was a horrific thing that happened that I didn’t bring on myself.”  There are some areas where the anxiety still lingers. Andrews described the fear she gets any time she receives a notification that someone is trying to hack the password to one of her accounts.  “I instantly lose all feeling in my body, and I start to panic,” she said. “And I’m grateful for somebody that works with me that I’ll call her right away and I’m like, ‘It’s happening, it’s happening,’ and she’s like, ‘OK, OK, let’s look at the account.' “It’s the whole privacy, the violation thing that I have a very hard time with. I have a hard time with the word ‘stalker.’ I don’t do well with that word because I just hate it.”  Andrews tried to deal with the stress of the ordeal by taking solace in simply doing her job and interacting with NFL coaches and players.  “That’s probably really unhealthy because I didn’t want to think about it, but that was really the only way I knew I could recover and kind of get by,” she said.  With the final trial involving the incident having been resolved seven years ago, Andrews has moved forward.  “I feel like I’m on the other side,” she said.

Schmidt, welcomed their first child together. The couple recently welcomed a girl, Isabella Sloane Schmidt, via surrogate. Wallace became a mother for the first time in 2012 to son Liam with her former husband, Mark Wallace.  Alicia Menendez has been filling in for the anchor during her absence.  “Viewers of the program have probably noticed that Nicolle has been missing from this chair the past week,” Menendez said at the top of the segment before welcoming Wallace back for a brief return.  Wallace acknowledged that some fans had debunked the possibility that she was absent because she was having a baby.  “I understand why the truth was ruled out by so many people that Mike and I had a baby, “I have not looked at my phone in a week and am amazed at the theories out there,” Wallace, who is 51, said. “Mike and Liam and I are smitten with her,” Wallace continued. “Our dogs are still rendering judgment. But we were able to keep it secret, obviously, because I wasn’t pregnant, but I never meant to keep it secret from our beloved viewers. I am so happy to share our happy news today.” When prompted by Menendez to share what it is like to be a second-time mom, Wallace shared that “there are pros and cons to being a mom again 51.” “You are tired. I was up all night last night, and I was, like, ‘wow, yeah, this is what 3:45 a.m. looks like,’” she said. “I don’t see it a lot anymore. But it’s a blessing to be, you know, focused again on what has always grounded me, and that’s my beautiful family.” “My son Liam is 11 and was in the hospital and scooped her up in his arms and was calmer than we were at the beginning,” Wallace said. Despite being a preteen, Wallace shared that Liam has a “knack” for taking care of his little sister. “He just has a knack for the sway and the ‘shh,’ you know, all the things that you do no matter where you are when you have a baby,” she explained.  It’s uncertain when Wallace will return to her show, but for now, it seems she missed her viewers, whom she says she considers family. “You know, this show is my other family, and I would never leave,” Wallace said. “I certainly would never leave in a moment this dire.

Everything you’ll see here today is hand-painted, hand-sculpted, hand-fabricated by the talented artists here at Macy’s studios.” Dylan first took a look at The Deliciously Delectable World of Wonka by Warner Bros. Pictures float, which is inspired by Willy Wonka's first candy shop and features 500,000 pieces of prop candy, from a giant cherry tree to tiny sweets throughout the float. Next she was surrounded by the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem by Nickelodeon & Paramount float, a two-story structure that stands about 28 feet tall. During the parade, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo will scale the float, but before it arrives in Manhattan, it must be transported through the Lincoln Tunnel. The float has 11 hinges installed to be able to fold down and fit through the tunnel. ""At its top height it's 28 feet, but this will pack down to about 12 feet by 8.5 feet — about the size of a city bus. So we'll take this, we'll pack it down, we'll get it through the Lincoln Tunnel and then rebuild it on parade morning,"" Coss said. Dylan also got to see the Palace of Sweets by Brach’s float, a giant gingerbread house that stands about 30 feet tall that features a 25-foot rotating Christmas tree, a conveyor belt that brings candies from the bottom of the float to the top and windows for kids to wave to the parade's spectators. ""We love this pop of color — (it) brings a little bit of joy and excitement to the parade route,"" Coss said. Last but not least, Dylan took a look at the fourth new float for 2023: Igniting Memories by Solo Stove, which brings a camping environment to New York City with a natural rock formation and seating area. Macy’s has used 2,000 gallons of paint, 300 pounds of glitter and 200 pounds of confetti to create all of the floats.  In addition to the four new floats, Cher is set to perform a new holiday hit to kick off the season on 34th Street, according to the parade. The singer recently announced  .  In addition to Cher's iconic performance, seven new character balloons will take flight in the parade; Beagle Scout Snoopy by Peanuts Worldwide, Blue Cat & Chugs by Cool Cats, ""Kung Fu Panda’s"" Po by Universal Pictures’ Dreamworks Animation, ""Leo"" by Netflix, Inc., Monkey D. Luffy by Toei Animation Inc., Pillsbury Doughboy by Pillsbury; and Uncle Dan by Illumination. A new vehicle is also set to roll down the streets of New York City: the ""Good Burger"" Mobile! ""(It's) not every day there's a giant burger vehicle making its way down the parade route but we're excited to welcome our friends at 'Good Burger' celebrating 'Good Burger 2,'"" Coss said. ""It's the largest burger that's ever been a part of the parade — 5,000 pounds in its true form, which is about 1,500 actual little Good Burgers.""  will join the vehicle on parade day, Coss said, and TODAY's Al Roker chimed in that he has driven the vehicle himself. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is scheduled to begin on 77th Street and Central Park West at 8:30 a.m., 30 minutes earlier than ever before in New York and on the broadcast. The procession will march down its signature 2 1/2-mile route, heading down Central Park West to Columbus Circle, before turning onto Central Park South and then marching down 6th Avenue. At 34th Street, the parade will make its final turn west and end at 7th Avenue in front of Macy’s iconic Herald Square flagship location, and the festivities will wrap up by 12 p.m. Jon Batiste is set to kick off the festivities, and Cher will also perform during the parade. Other artists include Bell Biv DeVoe, Brandy, Chicago, En Vogue, ENHYPEN, David Foster and Katharine McPhee, Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors, Jessie James Decker, Ashley Park with the cast and Muppets of Sesame Street, Pentatonix, Paul Russell, Amanda Shaw and Alex Smith and Manuel Turizo. The Big Apple Circus, Cornell Bhangra, Tiptoe's Winter Guard, the world-famous Harlem Globetrotters, Maria Verdeja School of Arts dancers, St. John’s Dance, the Tap Dancing Christmas Trees, Spirit of America Dance and Spirit of America Cheer are also on the performance lineup. More than a dozen floats will transport the performers down the streets of Manhattan, and 12 marching bands are set to hit the streets as well. In addition to the seven new balloons, fan favorites like SpongeBob SquarePants and Pikachu will also be making return appearances. ""Diary Of A Wimpy Kid,"" DINO and Baby DINO, Goku, a Funko Pop!-inspired Grogu, Chase from ""Paw Patrol,"" Eevee, Red Titan from “Ryan’s World,” Ronald McDonald, SpongeBob's Gary and Stuart The Minion are also among the balloons set to return to the skies above NYC.

https://www.today.com/news/israel-hamas-reach-deal-release-50-hostages-pause-fighting-rcna126325,Israel and Hamas reach deal to release 50 hostages and pause fighting for 4 days in Gaza,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands  have  , a potentially landmark agreement that will also involve a four-day pause in fighting, the delivery of hundreds of aid trucks, and the release of Palestinian women and children held by Israel. The fate of the some 240 hostages captured in the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7 has been a source of anguish in Israel, with   and mounting political pressure  . The deal comes after weeks of mounting pressure   and other countries over the fate of civilians in Gaza, where local officials say more than 14,000 people including 5,000 children have been killed in Israel’s aerial bombardment and ground assault, with more than 1.6 million displaced in a mounting humanitarian crisis. After growing reports a deal was close, the breakthrough was announced early Wednesday local time (late Tuesday ET) by Qatar, the Gulf state that hosts Hamas leadership and worked alongside the United States and Egypt to broker the agreement. Israel’s government approved the deal early Wednesday local time. Hamas, which carried out the Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed some 1,200 people, confirmed the deal in a statement, casting it as a chance to “consolidate the will of our victorious resistance.” It said that all hostages exchanged by both sides must be under the age of 19, although this details was not mentioned by any other party. Three Americans could be part of the first group of hostages released: two adults and a 3-year-old girl named Abigail, a senior Biden administration official said. The pause, the start time of which is yet to be announced, is set to last four days, an Israeli official said. Israeli drones —  , and whose buzzing noise is a constant psychological burden on many Palestinians — will stop flying over the strip for six hours a day as Hamas consolidates the remaining hostages, the official said. Some captives are being held by other militant groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The deal includes an option to extend the pause in exchange for 10 hostages released per day, the Israeli official said. Meanwhile, more fuel trucks will also be allowed to enter Gaza, which Israel had previously resisted on the grounds this can be used by Hamas to launch rockets and power tunnels, along with as many as 300 to 400 daily humanitarian aid trucks, according to a senior U.S. official and a source familiar with the talks in the region. In addition, said an Israeli official briefed on the proposed deal, the Red Cross is expected to be allowed access to the hostages who remain in Gaza, including to provide them medicine. The agreement capped what the Biden administration official described as an “extremely excruciating five-week process” to free the hostages. President Joe Biden was directly involved in the negotiations and received hourly updates on the progress, the administration official said. Among the sticking points, they said, were Israel’s requirement that Hamas provide identifying information and “proof of life” for the hostages and Hamas’ demand that fuel enter Gaza. Biden said   late Tuesday he welcomed the agreement. First lady Jill Biden “and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented,” he said. Before the deal was announced, Netanyahu stressed that it would not mean the war with Hamas is over. “We are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals — to eliminate Hamas, to return all our hostages and missing persons and to guarantee that there will be no factor in Gaza that threatens Israel,” Netanyahu said in remarks Tuesday before the Cabinet vote. “There are stages in a war, and there are also stages in the return of the abducted,” he added. One remaining hurdle is that Israeli victims of alleged Palestinian attackers held in jails have a right to appeal a deal involving the prisoners’ release to the Supreme Court within 24 hours. So the deal is not final until that period closes. Only four hostages  : Nurit Cooper, 79; Yocheved Lifshitz, 85; and two Americans — Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie. Israeli forces also freed a soldier who had been taken captive, Pvt. Ori Megidish, 19. Last week, two hostages were confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces: Yehudit Weiss, 65, a mother of five captured in the Be’eri kibbutz, and soldier Noa Marciano, 19. Their bodies were found near Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, the IDF said. Patrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.

Try these 3 stretches to relieve gas,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Holiday meals filled with carbs, salty snacks and bubbly cocktails are tasty going down, but often leave us feeling bloated. Bloating can be frustrating and uncomfortable. While the discomfort likely leaves you wanting to lie on the couch, movement is actually one of the best ways to find relief. Walking can help. But if you can't imagine lacing up your sneakers, you’ll be happy to hear that gentle, slow stretching is an  . Twisting motions in particular help improve circulation, helping your body release tension and excess gas. So if you’re feeling bloated, performing   with gentle twists is the way to go. Even as a health expert who closely watches my diet, I still get bloated sometimes. Often the last thing I want to do is move, but once I get down on the ground and start stretching, my stomach feels less like a balloon and I am able to move around much more comfortably. So after that big holiday meal, try this easy three-move sequence. The stretches are simple, yet effective, and can be completed in just a few minutes. Remember to take it slow, twisting your body gently before releasing. Begin in a seated position with your back upright and your legs straight out in front of you. Open your feet as wide as the mat. Straighten your arms out to your sides so that they are parallel to the floor and in line with the shoulders. Inhale before moving, and then exhale as you twist your torso toward the left while keeping your hips square. After twisting as far as you can, count to three and pulse the right arm toward the outside of the left foot. Then move back to the starting position and alternate sides. Repeat 10 times, remembering to move slowly throughout. This is another Pilates move that involves twisting your torso, making it a perfect exercise for de-bloating. Start by lying on your back with your legs straight out in front of you. Slowly lift your legs straight up toward the ceiling. Open your arms out to your sides as anchor. Keeping your feet together, rotate your legs toward the right while twisting your upper body and head toward the left. Hold the position for a few seconds before returning to the starting position and alternating sides. Repeat 10 times per side. If this is too challenging, keep your knees bent at a 90-degree angle and perform the exercise. This move stretches your sides and gently twists your upper body. Sit on the mat with your legs folded to the left. Make sure the sides of your feet are lying on the mat. Straighten your left arm above your head and straighten your back before stretching toward the right. Place your right hand on the mat for added support if needed, but make sure to place it further away from your body to help the stretch. Keep your left hip on the ground throughout. Return to the starting position slowly before switching sides and stretching to the left. Repeat 10 times, and then switch the position of your legs and perform 10 more times.

She also claimed that throughout their relationship, the rapper punched, kicked, beat and stomped on her.

There’s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.” “I’m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it,” Swift continued. “I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.” Swift fans believe the singer was paying tribute to Machado when she performed her ballad “Bigger Than the Whole Sky” as a surprise song during her Nov. 19 show.

https://www.today.com/parents/family/what-is-gentle-parenting-rcna126171,What is gentle parenting?,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Gentle parenting is a modern method of connecting with kids that often looks wildly different than the way today's parents were raised. This approach suggests that we shouldn’t threaten or reward our children. Instead, we should help guide them through the decision-making process so they will arrive at a healthy response on their own. For example, if a child growing up in past decades was slow to get out the door in the morning, a parent might shout, ""Hurry up! You're going to be late for school!"" The gentle parenting philosophy asks parents to dig a little deeper to understand why a child might be dawdling in the morning. Are they deep in pretend play? Are they reluctant to leave the comfort of home? Are they having trouble with a classmate?  In understanding that underlying desire of the child, the parent can better enlist the child's cooperation by saying something like, ""I know you're having so much fun playing with your stuffies. Let's leave them right by the door so you can play with them the second you get home."" Also called ""respectful parenting,"" ""conscious parenting,"" ""mindful parenting"" or ""intentional parenting,"" gentle parenting is a ""nurturing style of raising children that allows parents to partner with their little ones to promote growth and development,"" says Amanda Vierheller, an early learning specialist and co-founder of  . ""This parenting style encourages open communication and reflection to lead children in making positive choices independently."" You have probably already seen examples of gentle parenting in  social media through  , who often provides how-to scripts to help parents understand what kids are feeling. Or maybe you've listened to Janet Lansbury's "" "" podcast that uses specific situations to demonstrate her respectful approach to raising children. And that understanding and respect is key here. Rather than seeing the parent as the authoritarian ruler and the child as the unquestioning subject, gentle parenting evens the playing field a bit. Yes, parents are still enforcing boundaries and making important decisions, but they also treat children as fully-realized human beings with thoughts and preferences. Instead of ruling with an iron fist, parents use empathy and kindness. Once parents provide structure and support, kids gain confidence in their own abilities, helping them approach the world more independently. They're not waiting for parents to tell them what to do because they know their parents trust them to make decisions. According to Vierheller, gentle parenting can use a handful of different techniques, like using specific, meaningful praise, giving explanations rather than orders and creating open dialogue for communication. ""Natural consequences, rather than punishment, are used to guide little ones while encouraging social-emotional learning. Gentle parenting respects the feelings and thoughts of children, empowering them to become confident,"" she says. Rather than banishing an emotional child to a silent corner of the house in a time out, Vierheller says you should instead ""support little ones by providing hands-on tools to help them process and manage feelings, such as books, fidgets, stress balls and plush toys.”  You want your kids to know that you are always there for them to discuss any feeling they may have, even if it seems big and scary.  “Many of us respond to this [gentle parenting] idea because we feel that we were parented without sensitivity, and we’re seeking to establish connections that we feel we lacked in our early experiences,” says Mariel Benjamin, program director at the   and Vice President at  , an online parent support system.  Even so, today's parents, especially those who grew up in a disciplinarian household, may have difficulty making the switch to this parenting style that doesn't rely on time outs or reward charts, which are very clear and actionable. It may take more time and emotional effort to provide the type of guidance and affirmation required by gentle parenting.  If you are starting on the gentle parenting path, the   offers this advice:  Benjamin notes that gentle parenting doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach. You can find your own ""balance between limits and sensitivity.""  When you think about gentle parenting, you need to take the developmental age of the child into account. You can even begin incorporating gentle parenting into your routine with infants. As your child grows older, they will better understand the nuances of their emotions and your response. You can identify, validate and empathize with your child without giving into their demands or saying the dreaded, ""Because I said so!""  Benjamin says, ""Our goal is to show our children that we — the adults — can tolerate their distress and survive.""  Rosie Colosi lives in New Jersey and is a reporter for TODAY Parents.

https://www.today.com/health/what-cico-diet-all-about-calories-calories-out-diet-t191457,What is the CICO diet and can it help you lose weight?,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Some people think that losing weight is simple math. If you eat fewer calories than you burn then weight loss is inevitable, right? Well, that's the reasoning behind the CICO diet, but the truth behind weight loss is actually a lot more complex. The CICO diet isn’t a book or an eating plan endorsed by a health expert or celebrity. It’s a more general approach that involves eating fewer calories than you burn. Basically, the CICO diet ""plan"" is not really a plan at all — it's more like a rough outline. CICO stands for "" ."" The logic behind CICO is simple. Since a pound is equivalent to eating about 3,500 calories, if you want to lose about a pound a week, you need to shave 500 calories from your daily routine — which equates to 3,500 calories in a week. In CICO, this calorie reduction is achieved either by eating less,   or a combination of both. This simple mathematical approach to losing weight sounds reasonable. But the truth is that people’s individual experiences vary considerably when it comes to weight loss, so it’s actually impossible to accurately predict how much weight you’ll lose based on this math. The appeal of CICO is that there are basically no restrictions. As long as you stay within a calorie range that's in line with your body's needs, the theory is you can eat what you want and still lose weight — or maintain your current weight. To stay on track, people often use a calorie counter app when following a CICO diet. But managing weight with   isn't as simple as it sounds. When it comes to managing your weight, calories count — to some degree — but they don’t all count in the same way. There are three kinds of macronutrients that our bodies use to function: Each macronutrient breaks down into a different amount of calories per gram. Fats have 9 calories in a gram, and proteins and carbohydrates each have 4 calories in a gram. So, not only does each macronutrient contain a different number of calories, the body breaks down each kind of calorie differently. You can think of calories as the energy our bodies derive from food. Essentially, calories tell us how much energy it takes for our bodies to break nutrients down. Calories come from any food you eat — whether that’s an orange, orange juice or orange soda. However, the way the food is processed by the body makes a difference in how the body uses the calories created by breaking down nutrients. Some kinds of nutrients make you feel full because they take longer to break down and therefore stay in your body longer, and some are broken down quickly by the body and don't make you feel satisfied for very long. Certain foods are especially filling, which means that the calories from those foods give you a lot of bang for the buck — or a lot of fullness for the calories. The   is a ranking that indicates how filling a food is based on equal calorie servings of numerous foods. The rankings show, for example, that calories from boiled potatoes are seven times more filling than the same number of calories from a croissant. Calorie-for-calorie, fish is more filling than beef or eggs. Oatmeal is more filling than bran cereal. Rather than focusing solely on calories, it’s more effective to become aware of your calorie needs and to develop an understanding of how calories from various foods make you feel. Manage your appetite with filling foods that are also in line with your body’s caloric needs will help you manage your weight and hunger levels. Many Americans get a lot of calories from   — like sodas and packaged snacks, such as potato chips. In fact, research shows that Americans eat about  . While packaged foods are convenient, our reliance on these foods comes at the expense of other, more nutritious foods, like fruits and vegetables. Some   also report that processed foods may be linked to unintentional weight gain, higher blood pressure,   and blood sugar levels. In a   published in Cell Metabolism in 2019, researchers pitted a whole foods diet against a processed one. Twenty people went on both diets for two weeks, and while the meals varied dramatically, the calories, sugar, fat, fiber, carbs and protein were the same on both. Once meals were served, people were allowed to eat as much or as little as they wished. When on the processed food diet, participants ate many more calories (averaging an extra 500 calories per day) and they gained an average of 2 pounds. They ate faster, too, which may indicate they weren’t filling up sufficiently, or it may mean their brains didn’t have a chance to compute that they were full. There’s also the possibility that it’s especially easy to consume these foods quickly. (Think about how fast you can eat a snack bar made with oats compared to a bowl of steel cut oatmeal.) When those same people went on the whole foods diet, the opposite occurred: They lost 2 pounds. In other words, eating processed food really matters when it comes to  . So, it's not just the quantity of calories that makes a difference to your body, but also the quality. One criticism of the CICO model is that the method assumes that the number of calories that you absorb from every calorie is the same. That makes good hypothetical sense, but the truth is that our bodies don't actually work that way. Your body absorbs the calories consumed from eating whole foods differently, compared to processed ones. For example, if you’re tracking your calories, there may be slight differences in the number of calories that you think you’re eating compared to the number you’re actually absorbing. This can work to your advantage if you’re eating mostly whole foods — and potentially to your disadvantage if you aren’t.  that examine dietary patterns point to the fact that adults who consume the most servings of whole grains have lower body weights. One possible explanation is that calories from whole grains aren’t absorbed as efficiently as calories from refined grains. In one   involving both men and postmenopausal women, participants were assigned to diets with varying amounts of fiber, whole grains and refined grains, and the diets supplied each person a number of calories meant to keep weight steady. After six weeks, people who were eating whole grains experienced a lift in resting metabolic rate, which means they burned more calories when they were inactive. They also excreted extra calories in their stool. Together, this led to a daily deficit of 92 calories.  involving almonds have similarly found that we don’t absorb as many calories from eating nuts as we would assume, which may be why they’re also linked with healthier body measurements. Expert-approved diets — like the   — tend to include nuts. Liquid calories are especially problematic because there’s clinical evidence that your body doesn’t register them in the same way it registers calories that you chew, so sodas and coffee drinks aren’t as likely to fill you up. That's because there are nerves in the stomach that help your body sense how full you are by how much your stomach stretches and it stretches less when you consume liquid. So, if you drink high calories beverages routinely, you may wind up in a calorie surplus because you still need to eat — and therefore, consume calories — to combat hunger. The authors of a   published in 2021 called the method ""tragically flawed."" That's because researchers involved in the study found that when people eat high glycemic index foods — carbohydrates that cause a rapid jump in blood sugar — the body responds hormonally. The body starts to make more insulin — a hormone that directs sugar into the cells — and it makes more glucagon — a hormone used to release stored glucose. This hormonal reaction to eating foods with a high glycemic index effectively instructs our fat cells to store calories. Consistently telling your body to store calories is not ideal for weight loss or regulation. So it really does matter what you eat — not just how many calories. Regulating your body weight is a dynamic process that involves not only the calories and quality of food you eat, but other factors as well. , MS, RD, is a nutrition and wellness expert, author and columnist.

On Oct. 23, Vera Conner made her weekly trip to a Subway shop in College Park, Georgia, to order her usual: a #4 Supreme Meats from the  . She was expecting her Footlong to cost $7.54 but was shocked to find out later she was actually charged $7,112.98. “When I looked at my receipt, I was like ‘oh my God!’” Conner  , adding that she had somehow left a tip for $7,105.44 on her Bank of America credit card. “I thought this number looks familiar — it was the last six numbers of my phone number. Who would leave a tip like that?” Connor says she must’ve made the mistake while inputting her phone number into the Subway’s card machine as part of the chain’s loyalty program. She posits that at some point the machine must have changed to the tip screen, causing the error. Connor didn’t realize the costly flub until days later, when she was checking her receipts at the end of the week. “I thought it would be an easy fix ... then I got the denial from the bank,” Conner said. She added that the letter didn’t specify why her charge dispute was rejected. “That’s when I started worrying.” Conner said she called the Subway location and her bank, and even showed up at the sandwich shop in person to try to fix the problem. However, a Subway manager said her bank would have to handle it. Bank of America later said the refund was denied because the claim had to be resubmitted. Since Conner still had to pay $7.54 for her now-long-eaten sandwich, she would have to dispute the tip and the tip only. Subway declined to comment to TODAY.com, but did   on Nov. 20, saying they were aware that Conner disputed the charge and that Bank of America had requested a chargeback. When reached for comment, a Bank of America representative said Conner’s month-long nightmare is set to be over soon. “We asked Subway to refund the money to the client, and we’re pleased they have agreed to do so,” the spokesperson tells TODAY.com. Although Conner said she was finally issued a “temporary credit” for the charge on Nov. 20, she thinks using her card in the future may give her pause. “You hear all the time that you should use your credit card instead of your debit card so that these things don’t happen,” said Conner. “I’m even getting mad at the bank because I’m like how did they not think $7,000 was suspicious at Subway?” Washington, D.C. native Joseph Lamour is a lover of food: its past, its present and the science behind it.

Songs that make you feel something, I love a deep house track that gets my heart rate up, makes me want to dance, and while I love lyrics, I genuinely crave the way these songs make me feel,” Kennedy tells TODAY.com via email. “The beat, the build, the lyrics — whatever musical element speaks to us, it can create an arc for us to follow into the movement and the moment and inspire us to move beyond our expectations,” Morton tells TODAY.com via email. “In the moments of self-doubt, I pray for my girl Rihanna to come remind me who I am,” Sims tells TODAY.com in an email. And “KEEP GOING” helps her do just that. “I literally sing the words out loud to ‘keep going’ through the toughest moments of my workout,” Sims says. “Taking your mood and what you need into consideration are both important factors when choosing workout music because the playlist can impact how effective you will be,” Pryor tells TODAY via email. “There is absolutely no doubt that music can drive a workout, the mood of the workout and the overall enjoyment of it, too,” Lopez tells TODAY.com in an email.

The Food Network star, then known as Ina Rosenberg, met Jeffrey Garten when she was 15 on a visit to see her older brother at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Jeffrey Garten, who was also a Dartmouth student, spotted the future TV personality from the library window. “Look at that girl, isn’t she beautiful?” Jeffrey told his roommate at the time, according to  . Jeffrey Garten sent Ina Garten a letter with his photo — and she was impressed.  ""He saw me on the street and then sent me a letter with a photograph of himself in it,” she told   in 2018. “I just remember running through the house and going, ‘Mom, Mom, you’ve got to see this picture of this guy. He’s so cute!’” To hear Ina Garten tell it, her first date with her future husband, which happened months after she received Jeffrey Garten's photo,  Ina Garten suggested the pair visit a bar together on their outing. ""I thought, ‘Well, he’s a Dartmouth guy so he probably wants to, like, go to a bar or something.’ I had never been to a bar and so I said, ‘Oh let’s just go this bar, Hilltop,’ like I’d been there many times,'"" Ina Garten revealed during a 2022 episode of    But her plan hit a glitch when the doorman asked for her ID. “We walk in, and there are two big guys at the door … I didn’t understand what they were saying and finally Jeffrey said, ‘They want your ID,’ and I said to him, ‘What’s that?’ I had no idea that I needed a fake ID to get into a bar when I was 16.” The couple promptly turned around and left. “Why he ever wanted to see me again, I have no idea,"" Ina Garten told host Drew Barrymore. “Many years later I said to him, ‘What did you think, like, why did you want to take me out again?’” she added. “He said, ‘I thought you needed taking care of.’” Five years after meeting, the couple got married at Ina Garten's parents' house in Connecticut in December 1968, according to the    Jeffrey Garten had by then enlisted as an officer in the Army and he and his 20-year-old bride were sent to live in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Not long after marrying, Jeffrey Garten was sent on a deployment to Thailand for a year. “I wrote to Ina every single day,” he told   in 2018 of his time stationed in Thailand. “During the whole year, I was only able to call her once.” The adventurous young couple embarked on a no-frills   through Europe for four months 1971. Traveling across the continent on a bare-bones budget helped to bring them closer together. “If we can survive in a tent for four months, we can survive anything,” Ina Garten joked of the trip during a 2018 visit to  . While in Europe, Ina Garten fell in love with French food, which she cooked on the couple's small camping stove. ""She’d make beef bourguignon like it was nothing, then set up elaborate buffets for dinner,"" Jeffrey Garten recalled to the  . “It was the first formative period in her cooking,” he added. “All those little shops in Europe — the boulangeries — Ina would walk through them and just glow.” After returning to the U.S., the couple relocated to Washington D.C., where Jeffrey Garten accepted a job with the State Department. Ina Garten worked for several years as a a nuclear-budget analyst at the Office of Management and Budget,  .

Happily, Friday of Memorial Day weekend was a whole other story. “Life is all about taking a chance and figuring it out along the way. There have been easy days and tough days but they’ve all been fun and my, what a journey it’s been. Thank you to everyone who has come along for the ride.” Ina Garten published ""The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook"" in 1999. The initial 5,000 copies of the book — plus an extra 15,000 copies that the publisher ordered because of strong early press — sold out immediately. The book's success didn't surprise Jeffrey Garten one bit. “She has natural talent, but it’s backed by so much effort and so much focus,”  . “When she had the store, she’d work until midnight all the time. The discipline of her recipe testing and how seriously she takes it — she doesn’t settle for anything but the best. She’s like a runner who collapses at the finish line even though she was ahead the whole race.” The success of ""The Barefoot Contessa"" cookbook paved the way for Ina Garten to star in her own cooking show, also called ""The Barefoot Contessa,"" which debuted in 2002 on The Food Network.

In honor of the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in December 2018, Ina Garten shared the  “It’s just the luck of the draw,” she revealed in the Orange Room before appearing on TODAY. “I think you marry someone who thinks you’re just the most important thing in the world, and you think he’s the most important thing in the world.

https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/why-do-i-keep-getting-colds-rcna48315,4 reasons you keep getting colds every few weeks and how to prevent them,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands How many colds do you get in a year? The answer may be very different from person to person. So if it seems like you get sick with   while your friends are always spared, you might not be imagining it.  While it can be frustrating to wake up with classic   seemingly every few weeks or months, for some of us, it's not that uncommon. It's quite normal to get a cold or flu multiple times in a year, experts tell TODAY.com. We're regularly exposed to all kinds of illnesses including common cold viruses, such as rhinoviruses and  , as well as the flu, respiratory syncytial virus,   and COVID-19. And some people really are more likely to get sick more easily and frequently than others.  For most adults, it's normal to get somewhere between one and three colds per year, Dr. Otto Yang, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases and of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells TODAY.com.  But the truth is that ""people vary a lot,"" he adds. ""There are people that feel like they're sick the whole cold and flu season and other people that seem to be untouched by it."" If you're someone who gets colds frequently, that may be related to your age and how often you're exposed to illnesses in your daily life. Of course, if more illnesses are circulating — and if those colds are particularly easy to spread — that also makes it more likely that you'll get sick. But whether you're one of those people who can skip out on whatever illness is going around or you feel like illnesses just stick to you, there are   to prevent colds and stay healthier.  As it turns out, this is a surprisingly hard question to answer, the experts say. The number of colds you'll get in a year will be highly individual because it depends on ""how often you're exposed to people in public and what kind of activities you engage in that are going to put you at risk for getting frequent colds,"" Dr. Thomas Murray, associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the Yale School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. The normal amount of colds for you also  , likely because you have different levels of exposure to other people and illnesses at different points in your life, Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, tells TODAY.com.  The short answer? Research   that, for preschool-aged kids, it's not unusual to have very frequent colds — up to  , Esper says.  Once kids get older and can practice proper hand hygiene, the number of colds they'll get tends to go down to about four to six times per year, Esper continues. ""And by the time you're an adult, it's   a year."" There are a few different factors that determine how often get a cold, Yang says.  First, there's your level of exposure to a particular virus (and whether or not you take precautions to reduce that). Then there's the way your immune system reacts to that exposure, Yang explains.  Someone who tends not to go out and washes their hands all the time is going to be less likely to get colds than someone who is very social or has a job that requires them to interact with other people frequently, Murray says. Your age matters a lot when it comes to cold frequency: The type of exposure you get in preschool is likely very different than what you get as a college student, Esper explains, which is very different from your exposure as an adult working in an office. ""By the time you reach your 30s and 40s, you've actually been exposed to a lot of common cold viruses and have some immunity against them,"" Andy Pekosz, Ph.D., virologist and professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells TODAY.com.  On the other hand, ""kids have virtually no immunity to many of these common colds,"" he says, so they're much more susceptible. “Preschoolers are at the highest risk because they’re in a crowded area with a bunch of other children, and none of them have very  ,” Esper says. “What’s the hygiene of a 2-year-old? Well, that’s no hygiene, really. And that’s normal.”  Parents of young kids are also exposed to all the illnesses their children bring home. ""Parents, if they have kids who are in day care or kindergarten, they tend to get a lot more colds because of exposures,"" Dr. Bernard Camins, medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System, tells TODAY.com. After you're exposed to a particular pathogen, your individual immune system determines whether or not you actually get sick. ""People exist along the spectrum of being able to deal with certain types of infections better or worse,"" Yang explains.  The   is immensely complex, and small variations, defects and genetic differences between people can all play a role in determining whether you get sick and how sick you get, he says. In some cases, people who get sick frequently have an underlying condition affecting their immune systems. In those situations, people (especially kids) are more likely to require hospitalization for an infection and experience weight loss, severe fatigue and rare infections that others don’t typically get, Murray says.  ""Not every exposure ends up with an infection,"" Camins says. But if you are immunocompromised, you're more susceptible to getting infected even if your exposure level is the same as other people's, Camins explains. ""You're just more likely to get infected because your immune systems are weaker."" The good news is that, for most people who get colds frequently, “their immune systems may not be perfect, but they’re unlikely to have a serious problem,” Murray says. There's one other less obvious factor that might be making you feel like you're getting more colds than usual: multiple illnesses can be circulating at the same time. This past fall and winter, for instance, the U.S. saw high numbers of flu, RSV and COVID-19 cases all at the same time — particularly among children. That so-called ""tripledemic"" was partly due to "" ” Murray says, with RSV and flu cases spiking earlier than during pre-pandemic years and COVID-19 thrown into the mix.   When kids were mostly staying home due to the pandemic, experts think that many of them may have   — and the protection against future illnesses that provides. When precautions lessened, children were exposed to RSV again in larger numbers than usual, causing a surge. After such a widespread RSV wave last year, experts   this year.  ""After a couple of years of this pandemic effect, we're probably now going to start seeing (patterns in the U.S.) come back to what we saw pre-pandemic, in terms of the circulation of RSV, and influenza and other respiratory viruses,"" Pekosz says. ""These viruses quickly come back to an equilibrium where case numbers are then lower again because that pre-existing immunity is back in the population."" As of Nov. 21, 2023, respiratory virus season is beginning to take off. After weeks of decline and flattening in COVID-19 hospitalizations,   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now show an 8.6% rise in those numbers in the past week. And flu and RSV cases are beginning to rise as well,  . Experts are also monitoring a few concerning new coronavirus variants. First, there's EG.5, also called  , which is descended from the  , Pekosz says. The updated COVID-19 vaccines specifically target this group of strains, so it's likely to be a good match to protect against EG.5. EG.5 currently accounts for 22% of cases in the U.S. while another omicron-related variant,   is responsible for 29% of COVID-19 cases,  .  In terms of behavior, ""the best thing (we can do to prevent colds) is the same things we've been doing for the last two and a half years now,"" Esper says.  During the height of the pandemic, people were staying home, wearing masks and social distancing. And we saw a huge drop-off in COVID-19 cases, as well as flu, RSV and other illnesses. That's a reminder ""that there are things that you could do that really minimize your exposure to viruses,"" Esper says. Keep your distance from people who are ill if you can. And, if you're sick and able to stay home, you should do that to avoid spreading the illness to others, Esper recommends.  ""The best thing has always been  "" Esper says.  Pekosz agrees: ""Hand-washing is a great way to prevent yourself from the common cold,"" he says, adding that people should be mindful about   around others. If you can't wash your hands when you're out and about, ""using hand sanitizer to kill off a lot of these viruses can be very effective,"" Yang adds. Especially around people who may be sick and crowded, indoor areas where illnesses tend to spread easily. There's another ""underappreciated"" benefit of masking, too: ""Not only does masking filter the air, but it also   with dirty hands,"" Murray says.  In that way, a mask prevents you from ""transferring a virus you may have picked up from a surface (to your nose or mouth),"" Yang says. And, if you're sick, Camins suggests wearing a mask around others to help prevent spreading the illness. Pay attention to what's circulating in your area to ""get a sense for what you need to watch out for,"" Murray says. That includes COVID-19, but also other illnesses,   and RSV. Even if your symptoms are mild and ""cold-like,"" it's still important to rule out COVID-19. ""We expect to not see a massive surge in these cases this year, but they'll be around,"" Pekosz says. ""People should still think about   if they have mild symptoms because it's better to test yourself and have COVID than to risk walking around thinking you have a cold when you actually have COVID."" Get your flu vaccine and stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations because they can help prevent severe disease, Murray says. Back in September, health officials signed off on   that have been updated to target a newer coronavirus strain, XBB.1.5, a descendent of omicron. Because so many of the currently circulating variants are similar to this one, the updated shots are also expected to protect against other strains, TODAY.com reported previously. Everyone ages 5 and up should get a dose of the updated vaccines, the  , while younger kids may need more than one dose to be considered up to date. For flu, the   are still the same, Camins says. Everyone 6 months of age and up should get a flu vaccine. Plus, you can get your   at the same appointment, experts say. That can help you build up protection against both illnesses sooner and cross two items off your to-do list at once. Adults aged 60 and older can now get an  . And infants can also receive a   up to 8 months of age, Camins says, which will protect them during their first winter season. Another vaccine, given to  , can help prevent RSV during their baby's first six months. Young infants and older adults have a higher risk for developing severe, even life-threatening complications from RSV. Engaging in   can help keep your   functioning properly. That includes regular physical activity, eating  ,   and getting enough quality sleep.  But the experts say there isn't enough conclusive evidence for taking any   to prevent colds.

https://www.today.com/health/disease/mom-speaks-missing-signs-son-9-type-1-diabetes-rcna126203,Mom missed the signs her son had Type 1 diabetes. A co-worker may’ve saved his life,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands This past July, temperatures were sweltering, and Kathy Frost’s son, Norman, 9, started drinking a lot. At first, she thought little of it because everyone needed extra water to cope with the heat. She offhandedly mentioned Norman's   to her colleagues at the pharmacy where she works, and they urged her to take it seriously.  “My co-worker said, ‘I have two daughters that are Type 1 diabetics, and their journey started this way. They were thirsty all of the time,’” Frost, 40, of Greencastle, Indiana, tells TODAY.com. “The other pharmacist I worked with said, ‘You have to advocate for your son, and we’re going to find a clinic and you need to take him today to get checked.’” Frost did and learned Norman had Type 1 diabetes.  “I knew nothing about it,” she says. “You think, 'That’s not going to happen to my kid.'” Over the summer months, Norman attended day care while Frost worked. The day care workers noticed that Norman drank more than usual and needed to use the bathroom all the time.   “It (was) 90 degrees out,” his mom recalls. “It’s hot out. Of course, he’s going to drink more water.” One of the day care workers, who has diabetes, encouraged Frost to take Norman to the doctor because thirst is one of the symptoms. After Frost discussed it with her co-workers at the pharmacy, two agreed with the day care workers assessment. She took Norman to a local clinic, where doctors learned his blood sugar was 457 milligrams. A normal blood sugar range is below 140 milligrams, according to the  .  “The doctor was like, ‘You need to go to the ER right now,’” Frost says. “I would have never went (to the clinic) if it didn’t start with the day care telling me, ‘Hey, he’s thirsty.’” Frost took Norman to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, where doctors admitted him, gave him fluids and tested to make sure he was not in  , a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes. Luckily, he wasn't. Still, Norman stayed in the hospital for two days so they could learn how to manage his Type 1 diabetes. “The education part was phenomenal. The educator talked (at) Norman's level, asked questions that Norman related to,” she says. “The educator was actually a Type 1 diabetic, too, diagnosed when he was a kid. He showed Norman his   and insulin.”  A Dexcom is a continuous glucose monitor attached to a person's body to regularly monitor blood sugar levels. After two days and lots of bribes of Lego sets to encourage Norman, they returned home to grapple with blood sugar monitoring and insulin injections on their own. “I felt like we were leaving with a newborn baby, and we didn’t know what we were doing,” she says. “We’re navigating this new system, but he’s adjusting great.” While Type 2 diabetes remains more prevalent in the overall population, Type 1 diabetes is the most common cause of diabetes in children, Dr. Tamara Hannon says. “Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of the cells in our pancreas,” Hannon, director of the pediatric diabetes program at Riley Hospital for Children, tells TODAY.com. “There is a trigger of the immune system to actually start to destroy the cells in the pancreas that make insulin.” “The immune system gets tricked or gets confused,” Hannon explains. “Over time, your body gradually stops making enough insulin to keep blood sugar normal.”  Experts don’t full understand what triggers Type 1 diabetes, which makes it tough for doctors to predict who might get it. “Chemicals in our environment may be triggers. Different foods have been studied as triggers,” she says. “There may be many things that could be triggers that we don’t know our understand.”  Type 1 diabetes causes an insulin deficiency, so people with it need to receive insulin to survive. “The treatment is to replace what is missing,” Hannon says. “A person with Type 1 diabetes cannot live without insulin, and the only way we have to give it is by injection under the skin.”   Hannon says that parents need to be aware of symptoms, which include:  “Without insulin, our cells starve because we’re not able to get sugar into the cells, and the sugar provides the energy,” Hannon explains. “When the cells are starving, we need to break down fat in order to stay alive and have energy so weight loss is another (symptom).” It’s important parents talk to their pediatricians or take their children to the hospital if they notice the symptoms. If left untreated, patients can develop diabetic ketoacidosis — when ""acid has built up in the person’s blood so much that they could have a coma and they could die,” Hannon says. That’s why she encourages people to speak up for their children.  “I would advocate for them to get tested because you can have a situation where the child becomes sicker than they absolutely should,” she says.  Norman loves math and helps his mom figure out how much insulin he needs based on the amount of carbohydrates that he eats. While he’s been engaged in caring for himself, he felt ashamed that he had Type 1 diabetes and kept it a secret. “He is embarrassed about having it,” Frost says “When he first got diagnosed, he wouldn’t tell any of his friends.”  Since he received his Dexcom, he's told his friends and they think it’s cool.  “It made him feel a lot better about the situation, having to have this device on his arm,” she says.  While Norman doesn’t like giving himself insulin shots, he lets his parents give them to him with little fuss. Frost says he’s a “warrior” and is glad that managing his Type 1 diabetes helps him to continue enjoying life.  Frost wanted to share their story to help other families.  “I want people to know the signs,” she says. “I want them to advocate for their children.” Meghan Holohan is a digital health reporter for TODAY.com who covers patient-centered stories, women's health, disability, rare diseases among other topics. She enjoys cooking, yoga, reading, music and walking her two rescue dogs.

https://www.today.com/parents/family-s-gratitude-tablecloth-has-21-years-signatures-t200660,The 'gratitude tablecloth' is an amazingly easy tradition you can start today,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Years ago, Caroline Harrington, a mom in Minnesota, was watching TODAY when Katie Couric shared a special  tradition. “Katie had this idea to get a light-colored tablecloth and have everyone go around and write what they’re thankful for,” Harrington told  . “My family has been doing it ever since.” The Harringtons'  is now 19 feet long, and after more than two decades, the linen is dotted with gravy and cranberry sauce from Thanksgivings past. But the retired massage therapist and her husband Denis Harrington, don’t mind one bit. “It’s just part of the memories,” Harrington explained. “I used to wash it, but then the messages were starting to fade. So I thought, ‘Heck, I’ll just shake it off and we’ll have some stains.’” Harrington, whose four sons are now grown, considers the tablecloth a piece of their family history. It includes signatures from relatives who are no longer alive, including Harrington's father. “Everybody loves it because it’s just so simple and anyone can do it. All you need is a Sharpie,” Harrington said. For kids who can’t write, Harrington suggests tracing their hands. “Anyone can be included,” she said. “You’ll go back and laugh at some of the things like we have.” Rachel Paula Abrahamson is a lifestyle reporter who writes for the parenting, health and shop verticals.

https://www.today.com/health/mystery-dog-illness-2023-rcna125553,A potentially fatal mystery illness in dogs is spreading in the US. It starts with a cough,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands A mysterious and potentially fatal respiratory illness in dogs has been reported in several states across the country, as veterinarians continue to search for what may be causing the condition that has killed some dogs. The illness starts out as a cough that can last for several weeks, but it may not respond to typical treatment, such as antibiotics, which can leave the dog struggling to breathe and with severe pneumonia. ""It seems to happen very, very quickly — to go from this cough that’s just won’t go away ... and then all of a sudden they develop this pneumonia,"" Dr. Lindsey Ganzer, veterinarian and CEO at North Springs Veterinary Referral Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, tells TODAY.com. Dr. Gina Kettig, veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, said in   that she's seen ""a plethora of these infections and it's concerning. ... We are using our isolation ward heavily with all of these infections."" Ganzer estimates her hospital has seen over 30 dogs with the condition since the middle of October. Most of them had recently spent time at a boarding facility or doggy day care. She adds that cases are ""really not slowing down,"" with two to three coming in a day, most requiring hospitalization. She says four to five of the dogs her hospital has seen have died due to the illness, but they arrived already in respiratory distress with pneumonia. It's not a time for dog owners to ""become paralyzed with fear,"" Dr. Kurt Williams, director of Oregon Veterinary Diagnostics Lab, who's been researching the illness for the past month and a half, tells TODAY.com. ""I think concern is fine,"" he says, adding that dog owners may want to consider taking precautions to prevent illness, such as avoiding scenarios with other dogs and making sure dogs are up to date on vaccinations, especially against respiratory diseases. Dogs with this mystery illness usually have coughing, sneezing, eye or nose discharge, are abnormally tired, and do not test positive for any common causes of respiratory illness, the Oregon Department of Agriculture noted in  .  Typically, dogs with respiratory illnesses have a cough for seven to 10 days, but some vets have seen an uptick in dogs with coughs lasting weeks to months, the Colorado Department of Agriculture tells TODAY.com in a statement. Dogs are most likely to contract the mystery illness by being in close contact with numerous other dogs — so places like day care, dog parks, groomers or boarding kennels, Ganzer explains. Since mid-August, the Oregon Department of Agriculture has received reports of over 200 cases of the illness from veterinarians in the state. It's not known how many dogs have died. An Oregon Department of Agriculture spokesperson tells TODAY.com that cases are still being reported and that the department is working with other authorities to try to find the cause of the illnesses. Veterinarians who see cases are encouraged to report them to the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The Colorado Department of Agriculture tells TODAY.com that it is not currently tracking case numbers. ""Canine respiratory disease outbreaks do happen from time to time; but from what we are hearing from private practicing veterinarians and our colleagues at CSU, it seems that they are seeing double the number of cases than they normally do,"" the statement says. ""Our office has fielded a large number of calls over the last several weeks from practicing veterinarians seeing an influx of cases in their clinics."" ""The number of deaths due to this outbreak seems to be small compared to the total number of cases they are seeing,"" it adds. Dr. Amanda Cavanagh, head of urgent care services at Colorado State University James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, in Fort Collins, Colorado, tells TODAY.com this past summer she started seeing cases of dogs with coughs lasting several weeks or longer, and the trend has continued into the fall. She estimates her caseload of coughing dogs has doubled over the past month or so. While dogs with a contagious cough are common in veterinary settings, Cavanagh notes that she normally sees cases decrease in the fall as temperatures drop and fewer dogs are gathering at parks. ""But this year, the spike has stayed high,"" she explains. In its press release, the Oregon Department of Agriculture noted that the illness can progress in three ways: a mild to moderate cough for six to eight weeks or longer that either doesn't respond to antibiotics or only responds a little; chronic pneumonia that doesn't respond to antibiotics; or severe pneumonia that ""often leads to poor outcomes in as little as 24 to 36 hours."" Cavanagh has witnessed all three scenarios play out at her hospital. Recently, she's seen more dogs than usual with a long-lasting upper respiratory infection who then develop pneumonia from a secondary bacterial infection. In a small subset of these dogs, the pneumonia can be ""really severe,"" she explains. Of the dogs she's treated, she says most who develop pneumonia respond to antibiotics, and many with a long-lasting cough recover with time and never get pneumonia. But of those who develop the severe pneumonia, some have died or had to be euthanized. ""That really bad pneumonia, historically, is very, very rare. Maybe I would see one case a year,"" Cavanagh says. ""We've seen a handful of them in the past weeks to months."" While this mystery dog illness is making headlines in 2023, Ganzer notes that it's been around since last year. Her hospital has been sending off samples from the dogs to University of New Hampshire’s Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory, which has been studying the illness since 2022. One of the biggest challenges of this mystery illness is defining what cases “fall under this umbrella of this particular entity that we’re all investigating,” Williams says. That’s because dogs can develop a cough for many reasons, and it takes time to rule out known causes. “We’re still trying to pin down a potential cause or causes for the entity. At least in Oregon, it’s given us some some challenges,” Williams says, adding that he was contacted late Wednesday about running tests on a dog that died from severe respiratory disease. Researchers at University of New Hampshire’s Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory told NBC News that they've identified a bacterium that could be behind the surge in respiratory illness in dogs, but more testing is needed to confirm. The bacterium is smaller than normal bacteria and hasn't been known to cause disease before, Dr. David Needle, pathology section chief at the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the University of New Hampshire,  . Smaller bacteria can sometimes cause worse illness because it's easier for them to bypass the dog's immune system and get into the respiratory tract and lungs, Dr. Karl Jandrey, professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, told NBC News. According to Ganzer, the Oregon Department of Health and NBC News, cases that match the description of the mystery dog illness have been reported, officially or anecdotally, in: The American Veterinary Medical Association tells TODAY.com in a statement that it's monitoring cases of canine respiratory illness and has been in contact with state officials. The association reiterates that the cause of the illness is still unknown. In recent weeks, there have also been multiple reports of outbreaks of a deadly respiratory illness in dogs at animal shelters in the U.S. The San Diego Humane Society has lost four dogs to a ""severe respiratory canine illness,""  .  However, the outbreak at San Diego Humane Society has been linked to two particular bacteria, Strep zoo and Mycoplasma. Dr. Zarah Hedge, chief medical officer at San Diego Humane Society, tells TODAY.com that she believes the outbreak at her shelter and others she's heard about — such as   — are not related to the mystery dog illness. That's because Strep zoo and Mycoplasma are easily treatable with the right antibiotics, which saved many dogs at her shelter during the recent outbreak. Also, the sick dogs she's seen didn't have a long-term cough, she says. The American Veterinary Medical Association also tells TODAY.com there's no indication of a connection between the outbreaks. That said, Hedge is still concerned about the damage that severe respiratory infections, both known and unknown, can cause in dogs, especially in shelters. ""We are seeing numbers of dogs coming into shelters that we haven't seen in a very long time,"" Hedge says. ""A lot of shelters across the country are overcrowded, and it just sets you up for disease outbreaks."" Symptoms of the mystery dog illness include: Ganzer stresses that any dog owners who notice their dog coughing, especially if they recently spent time with lots of other dogs, such as at a day care, kennel or dog park, should be taken to the vet right away. You shouldn't wait to see if the cough clears up on its own as earlier treatment makes a big difference in recovery, she adds. Ganzer says her No. 1 tip is to keep dogs from areas where they're likely to come into contact with other dogs (but do not delay taking your dog to the vet for needed medical care). Cavanagh advises dog owners across the country, regardless of whether they live in a state where cases have been reported, to follow this guidance. Keeping dogs out of these situations may be difficult for many families as the holidays approach because many people rely on boarding kennels when they travel. However, Ganzer says to avoid boarding dogs over the holidays ""if at all possible,"" adding that she's ""so scared"" about what may happen with the mystery illness after dogs across the country are boarded for the holidays. ""I understand that there are circumstances that are unavoidable and that some people have to (board their dogs), but I would not take this lightly,"" she explains. ""If there's somebody that can even just come to your house and let your dog out, that's a better option."" In light of the situation, Cavanagh says she's been keeping her own two dogs at home and avoiding settings where they may come in contact with other dogs. She also suggests avoiding any nose-to-nose street greetings between strange dogs. Williams agrees that it’s “prudent” to be concerned right now about putting dogs in scenarios where they may come into contact with  many other dogs. If you need to put your dog in such a situation, he suggests contacting your vet ahead of time for guidance. To keep your dog safe and healthy overall, Hedge recommends making sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations. Cavanagh also says that this year dogs should be vaccinated against respiratory diseases beyond the mare minimum, such as Bordetella and canine influenza. Be sure to give your dog two weeks after vaccination before interacting with other dogs so they can build up immunity. If your dog is sick, consult a vet right away, as early testing can help with treatment, and keep the dog away from other dogs to avoid spreading the illness, the Colorado Department of Agriculture advises. If your dog has been diagnosed with the mystery coughing illness, Ganzer suggests asking your veterinarian about submitting a sample to a research lab to help with the efforts to identify the cause.

Two rolls of toilet paper and a few raisins (or chocolate chips) aid in pulling this messy scene together. Don't worry, most kids think   — especially when it comes from an elf. It's time to bring a   to your home with some string and a pipe cleaner. Affix the string to adjacent walls and the pipe cleaner to your elves' hands and send them flying. What is more fun than scratch-off  ? Have the adults do the scratching the night before and arrange the tickets with your elf. Even better if you've got some winning numbers! Family photos will never be the same once the elf comes to town. Grab   (any color will work!) and stick them on family noses for a laugh-inducing wakeup.  It's time to take your child's favorite animals for a wild ride! Grab your elf and put them on the back of whichever animal toy got left out. Bonus points if it's a  , like this one. What is funnier than faces on food? Grab some eggs (or bananas) and, using a felt-tip pen,  . A toothpick works as your elf's conductor wand, or place the open pen nearby to indicate a crafty elf.  Parking jam! It's time for the toy cars to get involved in the seasonal fun. Line them up and put the elf on the   for some traffic that may surely make the kids smile. If you've got a   fan at home, this elf set-up will make them squeal. A DIY Spidey mask and some string to get your Santa spy swinging upside-down from a light fixture are all you need to make this one come together. What's more fun than a coloring sheet? A coloring party that gets started by your family's elf (or elves!). Print some Christmas coloring sheets or simply open up to a coloring book that has been laying around and let your elves go to town. In this example,   ... for the most part. For parents interested in upping the ante this year, here are a handful of creative Elf scenes that are sure to please ... but do require a bit of planning. Don't let the elves have all the fun this season. Coat a stuffed animal in   and wrap your elves' hands around the can. Just make sure a razor is out of reach of tiny hands! Everyone is a pro at video messaging these days, so bring the fun to your elves with a simple printout of a   (complete with Santa!) and a laptop set-up. Prep some stuffed animals, a DIY tent, a mini concession stand and a homemade trapeze to make this   come to life. Make breakfast fun with some  . You'll need strawberries, an apple, blueberries, coconut, a little creativity and some patience to bring this one across the finish line and mimic the creative idea. It's time to bust out the   and make the smallest room in your house one giant present. Not only is there a huge ""wow factor"" for kids, but it can serve as décor for the remainder of the season. Get all the stuffed animals involved in a  . Aside from a homemade Twister board (colorfully placed dots on a piece of printer paper), this scene requires a few stuffed friends and a DIY spinner. This is a mess worth making! Pop two or three bags of popcorn and use double sided tape to attach it to a long piece of wax paper. Sprinkle the rest on the floor just in time for wakeup and position the elves inside the microwave! This example does not feature the   Elf on the Shelf, but would be a cute idea to try with your very own  . It's time for your make-believe crew to bust out their  . Doll clothes work well, or if you're feeling really inspired, knitting homemade sweaters for the whole party is a possibility. Grab some cooked pasta, syrup and a collection of sugary sweets to bring this   together! The only thing you need to add is a homemade sign to pull off this play on Buddy the Elf’s favorite dinner from the Christmas movie “Elf.”  A tiny pool float will have your elf setting sail this season. While this is most fun in a pool or hot tub, as seen  , it would work in a sink or bathtub too. A kissing booth? For elves? We love to see it! Prep a   cut-out from cardboard (or other sturdy paper) and sprinkle chocolate Hershey's Kisses candy once your elf is tucked inside. Blow up a couple of small white balloons and make the ultimate   for your North Pole visitors. If your elves wear clothes, make sure to put them over to the side prior to ""jumping in!"" If you don't have balloons, bubble bath liquid and filling the sink with DIY bubbles works, too. Take your elves   with an enviable beach set-up complete with sand, tiny chairs, umbrellas and any mini sand toys you can find. The biggest obstacle might be wishing you could also be in Hawaii this season! Get out the tape and get to work!   puts a delightful twist on this set-up, but any tape will work to pin your elf to the wall (or door) with a homemade sign.  It's time to go ice fishing ... in the toilet. Cover your toilet with  , grab some Goldfish crackers and add some sugar to create the appearance of cracked ice. Your elf will need a fishing pole, too! Write some ""punny"" notes on   and stack them on the back of the toilet, so the family can see them first thing in the morning. Bonus points, because this can be done pretty quickly! Get into the recycling bin to create a can choir for the kids this year!   halfway to create a torso and ""legs"" look, draw on faces and assemble an audience of elves. Googly eyes help, too! If you've got clean laundry, you've got what you need to prep this silly scene. The kids will laugh out loud when they see their   draped all over the tree.  Everyone knows an elf's favorite drink is  ! Grab a straw and whatever kind of syrup might be in your pantry to make sure your family's visitor has their favorite seasonal sip. Print the funniest human (or animal) body you can find and do a little peek-a-boo elf cutout. If you attempt a   one day, maybe try an animal later in the month. We love a multipurpose idea! The pets can get involved in this year's elf games with some tape and a homemade sign. It helps if your   beside their own hijinks for a morning photo! A little ""pun"" never hurt anyone!   needs some yarn hair, a mini guitar and, of course, a face. If stick-on eyes are too much, a marker works great too. The sign is the final touch for this refrigerator masterpiece. Walk down the steps and put the  . No need to overthink this one! As you exit your bedroom, grab a roll of toilet paper. Pick up the elf from yesterday's spot, insert them into the T.P. and   down the hall or steps. Easy peasy! Make the household appliances a fun prop this year, especially if you're up against the clock. All you'll need is your elf, some tape and any rogue toy that's laying around. Tape the friends together with their arms up as if they're on the most   ... inside your dryer! The shoes at the front door are likely piling up, so quickly put together a   for your elf to ride. Of course, the elf can go in the lead shoe and serve as the conductor. Maybe the family pet thinks your elf is a toy — we will never tell. Pose them next to each other when you hear the kids coming and your   is done! Elves just want to have fun — and  . Have the family elf take some funny selfies on your phone to share with the kids, or prop your phone up as they're padding down the hall in the morning as if the elf was caught in action. Finally, the family elf is pulling their weight around the house ... sort of. Put your Santa spy on an   and let them go for a short spin in the morning. No Roomba? No problem! Attach your elf to a mop, stand-up vacuum or broom. Need to quickly throw — err, put — the elf in its place? A baby doll bed, a dollhouse, a play kitchen, a bassinet ... these elves can find any nook to nap! It's time to take these dogs for a walk! Use pipe cleaners to make leashes for the tiniest paw patrol and prop the elf up against a house plant or any décor you've got handy. Take some lipstick and write a gentle reminder to the kids on the mirror. From the elf, of course. Another fun message might be: Don't forget to smile! Whether your kids are flossing their teeth or doing a dance, this fun elf scene requires dental floss and a tiny sign. You'll get cool parent points for knowing how to floss! Nutella, peanut butter, jelly or jam is going to be your BFF for this fun set-up. Simply get them from the cupboard and let your elves ""dive"" in to this slightly messy — but simple — scene. Tired parents rejoice! Put the elf between two picture frames or pieces of artwork in your home and call it a big win. Have cup, will elf — or something like that. If you're running down the hallway at dawn realizing that the elf hasn't moved, put them in a coffee mug near the coffee pot and call it good. Never forget to look up, especially when it comes to finding the elf each day. At least once a week, hang your elf from a light fixture or fan. Grab a jar (or maybe a takeout container with a lid) and trap your elf inside with some candy worms. A quick, DIY sign finishes this easy elf setup.  Whatever see-through cups you may have in the cupboard work well for this elf setup. Stuff your elf inside a cup or glass and leave the cabinet door open to make sure little eyes know there has been some mischief in the kitchen. No need to wrack your brain trying to get this one right — just raid the pantry. One potato, a grater and a handful of chips is all that is needed to make this chip-per scene come to life. Extra points for parents who can make the best worried potato face using a marker. Maybe the elf is helping pack your child's lunch, or maybe they're just waiting to get caught at breakfast. Whatever the case, wrapping your elf around a fridge item may just be the fastest way to pose it this season. Running out the door and remembering the elf hasn't been moved? Don't panic, we've got you. Put the elf on the dashboard of the car or affix them around the rearview mirror for a fun carpool drop-off (or pick-up) this season. Listen, it's only natural an elf would miss the polar weather this season while visiting. Throw them in the freezer and act surprised when the kids find him or her peeking out from behind the popsicles. Kait Hanson is a lifestyle reporter for TODAY.

You can string 5-7 together for a well-rounded, full-body workout. The moves will   (including your biceps, triceps and shoulders), your core and your  . I recommend starting with light weights (think: 2 or 3 pounds), and working to increase your repetitions to 15 before increasing the weight. Hold the weights down by the thighs, keeping them vertical. Bring the arms up on a diagonal and out as wide and as high as the shoulders. Lower the weights down. Repeat 10 times. This move combines a simple march in place with a  . Begin marching in place, making sure to bring your knee up so that your thigh is parallel with the ground. Once you establish a pace, begin to incorporate the bicep curl. When your right knee is in the air, perform a bicep curl with your left arm. Continue to alternate, keeping a comfortable pace. Perform 10 bicep curls with each arm. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold the dumbbells in front of your chest. Step your right leg behind you and to the left, crossing it behind your left leg, while lowering into a lunging position (as you would to perform a curtsy). Return that leg to a standing position before lunging with the left leg by crossing your left leg behind the right. Repeat 10 times on each side. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Stand with your feet as wide as your hips and reach the arms down along your sides. Pull the abs in. Then extend the arms straight out to the sides and up as high as the shoulders.

This time as you return to standing, extend your left arm straight out in front of you in a punching motion. Repeat 10 times per arm. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold one dumbbell in each hand. Bend your elbows and lift the dumbbells into a goal-post position so that they are aligned with your shoulders. Breathe in and push the left arm up overhead as you tap the left foot out to the left, then come back to center. Repeat to the right. Alternate sides for 10 reaches per side. The Russian twist is a great addition to any  . The twisting motion works your obliques, so you’re activating multiple core muscles at once, and   takes it one step further.

Then move back through center and twist to the left, tapping the dumbbell on the floor. Perform 10 times on each side. To start, hold the dumbbells in a goal-post position with the weights in alignment with the ears. The upper arms should be parallel to the ground and the forearms perpendicular to the ground. Press the weights up overhead, in front of your forehead slightly so that you can see them with your eyes without tilting your head up. Then bring them back to the starting position. Repeat this 10 times. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart, knees slightly bent. Hold one weight in each hand, and let your arms hang down at your sides. Hinge forward at the waist so that your chest is tilted at a 45-degree angle toward the ground. Perform a row by pulling your elbows up toward the sky, hugging them into your sides. Then, holding the elbows static, bring the weights up and back toward the back of the room into a  , working the upper back and back of the arms. Come back to the row position and then repeat 10 times. Stand with both feet on the floor, knees slightly bent and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms and fingers facing in. Hinge at the hips tilting the chest toward the ground at a 45-degree angle. Keep your chest open and roll your shoulders back. Pull both arms back as if you’re lifting a box from the floor. Be sure to keep your elbows hugged in to your sides and your back straight. Return to the starting position and repeat 10 times. Plant your feet on the ground and stand tall, keeping your back straight. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms at your sides; they should remain here throughout the exercise. Step your right foot back and lower down until there is a 90-degree bend in your right knee. Your right thigh should be parallel to the ground. Step back to standing tall and then repeat with your left leg. Alternate, performing 10 repetitions on each side. Stand with your feet hips-width apart.

On Nov. 21, Netflix shared an image of the Oscar-nominated star reprising his role as Axel Foley in the upcoming fourth “Beverly Hills Cop” movie, “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley.” “He’s back. Axel Foley returns in 2024!” the streaming service   on X of Murphy wearing his character’s Detroit Lions jacket while his hands are in the air, as police officers surround him and a crowd looks on. It appears as if Murphy is in an overturned vehicle, while a Ralph Lauren store is in the distance behind him. There is no date for when the movie will be released. Netflix revealed in 2022 that Murphy would reteam with original “Beverly Hills Cop” stars Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser and Bronson Pinchot for a new installment in the series. Kevin Bacon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Taylour Paige will also star. Murphy says a lot of time has passed since he made the original “Beverly Hills Cop,” a fact he felt while shooting this new effort. “It was a hard one,” Murphy, 62, recently  . “I did Axel Foley when I was in my 20s. I am not in my 20s anymore.” “It was an action movie. So it was a rough one. But we got through it,” he added. “Beverly Hills Cop” came out in 1984 and, along with his roles in “48 Hrs.” and “Trading Places,” helped establish Murphy as a comedy superstar, following his breakthrough work on “Saturday Night Live.”  Murphy again played Axel Foley in 1987’s “Beverly Hills Cop II” and 1994’s “Beverly Hills Cop III.” A fourth film was discussed for years. “They’ve been trying to get ‘Beverly Hills Cop’ together for 10 years, but the script has to be right,” he   in 2021 while discussing the release of another long-awaited sequel of his,    “I told you guys, I’m not doing any more money grabs. I’m not doing any more movies that’s like, ‘He clearly just did this movie for a check.’ I’m not doing any of those.” Murphy has also said the fourth film came together once a key figure from the first one signed on. “Jerry Bruckheimer, the original producer, when he got involved and he started developing the script, and he knew what ‘Beverly Hills Cop’ is supposed to be — when he got back involved, that’s when it all started to come together,” he   in January. “He put all the pieces in place that were required for us to make a great movie. I’m excited for people to see it,” he added. Drew Weisholtz is a reporter for TODAY Digital, focusing on pop culture, nostalgia and trending stories.

Homemade chocolate cake can be next level, and you don’t have to be an expert baker to whip up a top-tier chocolate cake at home. These recipes, which are sourced from avid bakers and accomplished pastry chefs alike, can be as easy as mixing common supermarket ingredients (don’t underestimate the role of boxed pudding in a moist dessert) or a bit more complicated for those comfortable with an electric beater and egg separation. The good news? Whether you’re strengthening your baking skills or just getting familiar with an oven, practicing a chocolate cake recipe results in fresh, homemade chocolate cake.

Here’s what to bake before you can dig in.  The chocolate cake is as classic as it gets, with one special twist — coffee. While it might seem like a strange ingredient, freshly brewed coffee actually helps enhance the cocoa flavor. Serve this on late nights, like   or before a big dance party, and with a cup of coffee or espresso.  Secret’s out: this chocolate cake is phenomenal. And not too difficult to make.

This two-layer cake is old fashioned and classic in all the right ways. Every bite is super chocolatey, thanks to a duo of chocolate frosting and chocolate cake made with both melted chocolate and cocoa powder. It’s one of the most popular cake recipes on the internet for a reason.  Forget the typical sandwich spread — mayonnaise takes on a second identity in this cake recipe. Adding richness, lushness and tenderness to the better, mayo is the hidden ingredient to a soft and luscious chocolate cake. The only other thing that this cake needs is a dusting of powdered sugar on top.  Flourless chocolate cake is its own kind of treat. Naturally  , it’s hard to tell this chocolate cake is even missing anything, thanks to its decadence.

This recipe is more about technique than it is baking (read: the cake can be from the store), and it relies on making a peppermint-flavored milk to douse the cake in.  Leftover wine (or a freshly opened bottle to drink while baking) is the key to this adult-friendly chocolate cake. Vegan chef Chloe Coscarelli’s recipe uses wine and vinegar for moisture and a little bit of  sweetness, plus fresh raspberries on top for a burst of color and fruity flavor. Pre-bought coconut whipped topping finishes everything off.  Five ingredients make this crowd-favorite cake. And all five ingredients are typical supermarket purchases. Chocolate cake mix and peanut butter unite for a flavor bomb that’s moist, nutty and chocolatey, and the addition of extra chocolate chips adds some nice meltiness. Switch it up for peanut butter chips if preferred.  Inspired by a fresh, frothy pint of  , this chocolate cake takes the stout to another level.

Inspired by Mexican hot chocolate, this cake combines graham crackers, cinnamon and chocolate for a hooey dessert.

Condensed milk adds a nice sweetness to the cake, which is served warm. Naturally, it pairs well with your favorite ice cream.  Beets in cake may seem odd, but Martha Stewart knows what she’s doing. A lot of processed sugar comes from beets, so it’s a flavor that you might be  familiar with. In this case, whole beets add a fudginess and dramatic dark hue to the sheet cake. Thanks to the inclusion of the root vegetable, this dessert is basically a salad.  Melissa Kravitz Hoeffner is a writer and recipe developer.

But the cooking-centric holiday is also a time for a lot of mishaps in the kitchen. Some cooking mistakes have more dire consequences than others — a dry turkey may taste like cardboard, but an undercooked one may sicken your guests with food poisoning.  Foodborne illness is caused by eating or drinking something contaminated with disease-causing germs such as bacteria, viruses or parasites, according to the  .  The top foodborne pathogens in the U.S. are salmonella, norovirus, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter, and staphylococcus aureus, per the CDC. These can contaminate many foods, including   , especially if food isn't handled or cooked properly, TODAY.com previously reported.  The symptoms of food poisoning — upset stomach, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting — typically resolve on their own within a few days, but they can become severe or deadly. Children under 5, adults over 65, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women are at the highest risk,  . It's important that everyone, from first-time cooks to experienced chefs, take steps to prevent foodborne illness and keep guests safe. Here are the most   people make while cooking for Thanksgiving and how to avoid them.  Washing your hands before, during, and after cooking is an essential food safety practice, not only during Thanksgiving but any other time you're preparing food for others.  “Cleaning our hands for a full 20 seconds with soap and water can really go a long way in cutting down the amount of bacteria on our hands before we start preparation,” Robert Gravani, professor emeritus of food science at Cornell University, tells TODAY.com.  Pathogens from our unwashed hands can be introduced into food, Gravani says, where they can grow and multiply. Frequent hand-washing also helps prevent cross-contamination while handling raw turkey and other fresh produce that won’t get cooked, Gravani says, so it’s especially important after touching raw meat or poultry.  Always make sure you’re scrubbing your hands with soap and water  and drying them on a clean towel — a quick rinse under the tap and wiping off on your apron won’t cut it.  You’ve planned, you’ve shopped and you’ve prepared everything so you can hit the kitchen running on Thursday morning. But if you start feeling sick, you need to find a replacement. According to the CDC, you should   while you are sick and for at least two days after symptoms stop. Gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea could be signs of norovirus, a highly contagious virus that can spread to others through contaminated food via unwashed hands,  .   is the leading cause of foodborne illness outbreaks in the U.S., and spreads year-round — but activity peaks during the winter months, TODAY.com previously reported.  Anyone with   immediately and avoid gathering with other people until they feel better.  If someone has an infected cut or burn on their finger, they can introduce that bacteria into food while cooking, says Gravani — for example, when mixing stuffing with bare hands.  These bacteria can enter the food and start to grow and produce toxins if the dish is left out for a period of time, Gravani says, which can cause illness when consumed later on. No one wants traces of blood or scabs in their food either. It’s important to keep raw poultry and meats separate during the cooking process to avoid cross contamination.  “Use one cutting board or plate for raw meat, poultry and seafood and a separate cutting board or plate for produce, bread and other foods that won’t be cooked,” Laura Ford, Ph.D., epidemiologist in the division of foodborne, waterborne and environmental diseases at the CDC, tell TODAY.com. The same goes for utensils like kitchen tongs, spoons and spatulas. If you plan on using the same cutting board or utensils to cook all your Thanksgiving food, this requires strict hygiene. “We need to make sure that we clean all those utensils very well after they come in contact with the raw poultry or meat,” says Gravani. Cutting boards, countertops and any other tools should be washed thoroughly with hot, soapy water after preparing each food item, says Ford.  are common ingredients in Thanksgiving foods like pie, cookies, cakes, casseroles and stuffings.   Yes, most flour is actually raw, Ford explains. This means it hasn’t been treated to kill any germs, per the CDC, so it needs to be cooked properly or it can make you sick. Raw eggs and raw flour can be contaminated with salmonella, E. coli or other germs, says Ford. That means not eating cookie dough or anything with raw flour and raw eggs that isn't cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, according to  . ""Don't wash the turkey, or any poultry for that matter,"" says Gravani. Why? If salmonella or other bacteria is present, it can splash and spread all over the kitchen sink, counter and other surfaces, which can contaminate other foods, like produce, that won't get cooked.  ""The USDA recommends that you not do it as well,"" adds Gravani.  A common Thanksgiving food safety mistake a lot of people make is leaving a frozen turkey on the counter to thaw, says Gravani.  This is because leaving the turkey at room temperature for more than two hours will allow the defrosting turkey — or at least parts of it — to sit in the ""danger zone,"" or between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, says Ford.  Once the raw turkey enters the danger zone, any organisms that are present like salmonella will grow and multiply rapidly, Gravani says. ""The temperature becomes unsafe, even if the center still frozen the germs could grow,” says Ford.  There are three ways to defrost a turkey: in the fridge, cold water or a microwave.  ""In the refrigerator, it takes 24 hours for every 4 to 5 pounds of turkey,"" Gravani says, adding that if you're defrosting a 20-pound bird, you'd have to start the process four to five days before, so planning ahead is very important. The turkey should be kept in a sealed bag or container so its juices don't drip onto other foods in the refrigerator, says Ford. The cold water method is a bit faster but requires more attention. ""First make sure that the original package is intact so that the water won't leak in and soak the bird,"" says Gravani. The cold water should be changed every 30 minutes until the turkey is thawed, says Gravani, and it takes 30 minutes for every pound of turkey.  ""The last method is in a microwave oven,"" says Gravani, adding that people should check the owner's manual of their microwave to be sure of the right power level to use and and how many minutes per pound they need to defrost the turkey. ""Certainly the size of the turkey is going to be a concern. Some turkeys are very large and some microwave ovens aren't,"" says Gravani, so make sure your turkey can actually fit before you rely on the microwave method. Once your turkey is safely thawed, it should be cooked immediately or as soon as possible, Gravani says. Once you are done adding seasonings and herbs to the raw turkey, try to get it in the oven.  This minimizes the amount of time the turkey is sitting at room temperature in the danger zone, when bacteria can grow and multiply rapidly, Ford says. “We recommend putting the stuffing in a casserole dish ... which makes it easier to ensure that the stuffing is thoroughly cooked,” says Ford, adding that a food thermometer should be inserted into the center to make sure it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. “You can you can still have the same great flavor and everything, but it’s much safer,” says Gravani.  ""We can't just look at the color of a product or the texture of a product to determine doneness,"" says Gravani, adding that turkeys are large, which makes it more difficult to determine if the entire bird is cooked thoroughly or not. ""A food thermometer is the best way to tell whether that product is done and whether those organisms are killed,"" says Gravani. All poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit at the thickest part of the bird, he adds. Stick the probe through the breast or under the wing until it reaches the center. It's fairly common to serve Thanksgiving food buffet-style, and having it sit out while people enjoy their meal and return for seconds or thirds. But cooked or perishable food has about two hours until it needs to be stored and refrigerated, says Gravani.  Bacteria like clostridium perfringens bacteria can produce spores, which grow and multiply rapidly in cooked food left to sit between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit for longer than two hours, says Ford. The refrigerator temperature should be set to at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, says Gravani, which ensures that it will keep everything cold enough and at safe temperatures. This is especially important when the fridge will be stuffed with warm leftovers. The freezer should be set to zero degrees Fahrenheit or below, says Ford, which will ensure any leftovers are thoroughly frozen. Instead of putting foil over the turkey or a big dish of stuffing and putting it into the fridge, cut these items up into smaller pieces first and put them in several shallow containers, says Ford.  Dividing and storing your food in smaller containers makes it easier to cool down, says Ford, and it also makes it easier to reheat. All leftovers should be reheated to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and you can use a meat thermometer for accuracy, the experts note.

https://www.today.com/parents/family/thanksgiving-family-etiquette-advice-rcna126000,Emergency Etiquette for Thanksgiving: What to do when in-laws attack,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands This holiday season, we're giving thanks for family ... well, for most of them. The blessings of family gatherings also come with a few burdens. We're grateful for pumpkin pie and TODAY.com's expert, Catherine Newman, author of   and longtime etiquette columnist for Real Simple magazine, who is here to answer some of our trickiest parenting questions. Ugh! It’s the worst — like being catcalled, but by your great aunt who’s politely passing you the gravy. And the stakes are high, since we know that kids are vulnerable to both disordered eating and unhealthy ideas about how they should look.  One   — and the problem appears to be increasing. So let’s start with your own most important response here: what you tell your kids about their bodies and what you tell them about what they’re hearing.  “Your body needs to be as healthy as possible so that you can do the things you want to do in the world,” is a great place to start. A child should understand that their body is not an ornament, an object or an invitation to commentary.  You can fill their toolboxes with some all-purpose deflections: “I’m lucky to be strong,” they can try saying, or “These legs definitely get me where I’m trying to go.” Or some redirections: “Did I show you my muskrat diorama?” or “Is there coconut in this pie crust?”  If you want to communicate directly with your relatives, you can explain to them in private that you’re trying not to focus on the kids’ bodies — “I know your intentions are so good, but it turns out that even positive comments can be harmful” — and offer them some other ideas for conversation. Many people genuinely don’t know what to talk to kids about, and they may welcome a quick primer on World Cup soccer, Taylor Swift, Marvel movies or LEGO. — When my kids were little, I wanted someone to make me one of those doctor’s-office eat-the-rainbow posters, but the honest version, with only white food: white rice, white bread, buttered noodles. Lots of kids eat like that — or go through phases like that — and you just keep exposing them to different foods and cheering them on for tasting new things.  But healthy eating in general is a separate issue from the one that’s on the holiday table, which is whether your MIL is going to judge you for what your kids eat. And what, if anything, you should do about that.  A sidebar here, but isn’t it annoying that it’s always the moms who get judged for how kids behave? Why is it not your husband — her own child — who bears this extra special burden? OK, OK, back to your question. Here’s the thing: it really doesn’t matter what your kids do or don’t eat at one particular meal, and you can communicate that attitude to both your kids and your MIL.  “Oh, the kids have been talking about your cloverleaf rolls all year,” you can say. “I promised them they could eat their fill. Don’t worry, though. I am thrilled you made all these lovely vegetables, and I’ll be having their portion of green-bean casserole.” If she presses it, just say, “It’s a special occasion, so this isn’t a battle I’m picking right now.” It’s fine for the kids to learn that there are different rules on different days (maybe they find toys inside a stocking on Christmas morning, but that doesn’t mean that they can just tear into everybody’s socks all year and get stuff). Can you have pie and only pie for dinner every night? Of course not. But aren’t holidays fun? I think you should encourage your kids to dress up for dinner if that’s the family culture of your holidays. Not because of the snarky comments (sigh) but because it’s good for kids to learn that sometimes you defer to what other people care about.  “I love the way you guys usually dress,” you can say, “but it’s important to Nana and Papa that everybody look fancy for the holiday, so we’re going to wear our nicest clothes.”  Here’s where I diverge from more traditional ideas about dressing up, though, because I think there’s a lot of room for interpretation. When you take your kids to buy dressy clothes (we’ve always done this type of shopping at a thrift store), encourage them to look for outfits they’re truly comfortable in. Comfortable in terms of their bodies — no horrible choke-y neckties or a dresses with itchy lace — and also in terms of their sense of style.  At 12, my daughter picked a suit jacket she liked, which was how we learned that she’d grown to loathe girly clothes. Great! Whatever. It doesn’t really matter what they wear, as long as they’re willing to recognize that there’s a special occasion. This will come in handy later, too, when it’s a funeral or a wedding and they really do need to dress up.  But if they don’t get their fancy on for this particular holiday? If you decide they can just wear sweatshirts and track pants? That’s fine too. “I love that they feel so comfortable around you,” you can say if anybody bothers to bother you about it. “Aren’t we lucky to be together?”  Catherine Newman is the author of several books, including memoirs and  , and the new novel,   She wrote the etiquette column for Real Simple magazine for 10 years and is a regular contributor to The New York Times, O, The Oprah Magazine, Parents magazine, Cup of Jo and many other publications. Find her on  .    © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/health/cdc-new-covid-booster-side-effects-rcna104404,What are the side effects of the new COVID vaccine? CDC recommends new booster,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands As the United States enters the thick of respiratory virus season and the holidays approach, health officials are urging more Americans to roll up their sleeves and get the new COVID-19 booster. The updated vaccines are recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older to protect against severe illness this winter, according the  .  Unlike the last round of boosters, the new shots for 2023-2024 have been reformulated by manufacturers to target the latest variants. Since the CDC signed off on the vaccine rollout in September, millions of doses have arrived at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health clinics around the country. However, uptake of the new shots has been lagging. As of Nov. 17, only 14.8% of adults and 5.4% of children in the U.S. have gotten the updated vaccine, according to  . Amid concerns about a winter coronavirus surge, the Biden Administration is encouraging more people to get jabbed. “As we get into the holidays, we need to protect each other, and too few people have gotten the vaccine so far,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said on  .  Although the updated COVID-19 vaccines only target one variant, omicron XBB.1.5, the shots are expected to offer protection against more recent strains, including the  , EG.5 or ""Eris"" and BA.2.86 or ""Pirola."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three COVID-19 vaccine options so far: two   for everyone 6 months and older, and one protein-based non-mRNA   for everyone ages 12 and older,  .  The   everyone who is eligible get least one dose of an updated booster to protect against serious COVID-related outcomes, including hospitalization and death. Although COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations are trending downward after a  , experts expect cases to rise again this winter, following seasonal trends in recent years. What's more, cases of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are increasing, stoking fears about another "" "" of COVID-19, flu and RSV. “COVID continues to pose a health threat, but we have more and more tools,” said Cohen. “Getting vaccinated is still the most important way you can protect yourself and your family.” The initial vaccine rollout hit some speed bumps, including high demand at pharmacies, cancelled appointments and insurance obstacles,  . Last month, parents reported difficulties getting their   as providers struggled to stock up on child-size doses. However, experts say they do not expect long-term delays in COVID-19 vaccine availability, and the Biden administration says   for COVID-19 vaccines have largely been resolved. ""They did have some hiccups right at the beginning, but that's all been ironed out,"" said Cohen. Here's what else we know about the updated vaccine, availability, side effects and cost so far.  The newest COVID-19 booster is an updated vaccine that targets the   variant, which was the dominant strain circulating in the U.S. for most of 2023. Although many are referring to the updated vaccine as a booster, the shot looks different from its predecessors. It may be first of what will become an ""annual COVID-19 shot"" that gets revamped every year, similar to the seasonal influenza vaccine, Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of NYU Langone Vaccine Center, tells TODAY.com. Unlike the last round of boosters, the updated mRNA vaccines are monovalent, which means they target one variant.  , meaning it included two strains — the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and the omicron   subvariants, says Mulligan. The bivalent vaccine is no longer authorized by the FDA, the CDC said. In recent months, the XBB.1.5 subvariant targeted in the updated vaccine has been overtaken by new strains including HV.1,  ,"" F.L.1.5.1 (dubbed ""Fornax""), and XBB.1.16 or "" "" — which are all descendants of the omicron XBB lineage and close relatives of XBB.1.5, TODAY.com reported previously.  Fortunately, the updated vaccines are expected to provide good protection against the variants currently circulating, the FDA said.  This summer, a highly mutated new variant called   gained global attention after health experts thought it was more adept at bypassing immunity from vaccination and prior infection than other variatns. However, new data suggests BA.2.86 may not be as immune-evasive as initially thought and that the updated COVID shots are likely still effective against the strain.   prompts a strong immune response against BA.2.86 and generates neutralizing antibodies against other variants, including EG.5, and FL.1.5.1.   that its reformulated vaccine produces an antibody response against the various omicron sublineages in circulation. “The new vaccine is targeting subtypes of the omicron variant that not all of us have been exposed to yet ... so it’s not quite a booster. This is trying to give us immunity against a different version of the virus,” Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic, tells TODAY.com. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize a virus and fight it off before you get infected, says Mulligan. About 95% of the population already has some degree of immunity from prior infection or vaccination, he adds. However, this protection has waned over time, and the virus has mutated. The new COVID vaccine will act to ""update"" the body's immune memory so it can respond faster and stronger to the virus, Mulligan explains.  ""Receiving an updated COVID-19 vaccine can provide enhanced protection against the variants currently responsible for most infections and hospitalizations,""  . “The virus has changed, so you want the most updated protection you can get,” Cohen said. People can get the new COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax right now. The new boosters have already arrived to pharmacies, doctor's offices, health departments and clinics around the country, and doses will continue to arrive in the coming weeks and months.  ""There is plenty of supply of vaccines for COVID,"" said Cohen. The experts still encourage people to call their pharmacy or doctor's office ahead of time to make sure they have the shots in stock before making an appointment, especially if they want one from a specific manufacturer.  Another important change is that the   COVID-19 vaccination cards. Existing cards are still valid, but otherwise people can get their vaccination records from the pharmacy that administered their shots or state immunization registries,  . According to the  , the following people are eligible to get the following updated COVID-19 vaccines this fall and winter: The new vaccines are safe and effective, the FDA said, and its assessments have demonstrated the benefits outweigh any risks. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get the new COVID-19 booster. While the risk of COVID causing severe illness, hospitalization and death is highest among people ages 65 or older and immunocompromised individuals, it can cause hospitalizations and deaths among young and healthy people as well, Mulligan stresses. “While the vaccine is pretty good at preventing infection in the first couple of months after you get it, it’s very good at preventing severe disease, hospitalization and deaths many months after you get it,” Dr. Kawsar Talaat, co-director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Vaccine Safety, tells TODAY.com. So even if you do still get COVID-19 after vaccination, the experts note that it’s much more likely to be mild.  “We know the risk of   increases with each infection of COVID, and there is increasing data ... that suggests vaccination can reduce the risk of long COVID,” says Sampathkumar, adding that this is another reason for  . ""People are still getting long COVID symptoms from the virus even if you get a mild case,"" Cohen noted. Additionally, vaccination also helps produce  , which protects vulnerable individuals. ""If I am a young healthy person who is vaccinated and either doesn't get COVID or only has mild COVID, I'm less likely to transmit it to people around me,"" says Mulligan. Right now, the experts say. ""Get your appointment. It's never too late to get vaccinated,” said Cohen.  High-risk individuals should not hesitate to get the shot, experts note. However, if you've recently recovered from a COVID-19 infection, the experts recommend waiting a few months to get the updated vaccine. The   people with a recent infection should consider delaying vaccination by three months.  ""You (want) the immune system to go back into its resting state. ... In order for the updated vaccine to be most effective, you want to have mostly recovered from prior infection,"" says Mulligan. If you recently got the original COVID-19 vaccine or the bivalent booster this summer, the FDA recommends waiting at least two months before getting the updated vaccine. Individuals who are high risk and recently received the previous bivalent booster or recovered from infection should talk to their doctor about the best time to get the updated shot, the experts note. It is safe to get the   at the same time, says Mulligan, who recommends knocking out both shots during the same appointment. ""People are busy and it's efficient, so having the option of a 'twofer' is a great thing,"" he adds. Last week,   that its candidates for a new combination shot targeting both COVID-19 and the flu will move to final-stage trials following positive initial results from earlier stages.  A new RSV vaccine is available for   (to prevent RSV in newborns), and  . It is also safe to get all three vaccines at or around the same time, experts note. Side effects from the vaccine can vary from person to person and dose to dose, the experts note.  , the most common side effects from COVID-19 vaccination include:  ""Most of us have had several prior doses of the COVID vaccine, so it's anticipated that the side effects will be similar to what you had with the prior doses,"" says Sampathkumar. Side effects will typically go away within a day or two, Mulligan notes, and these can be managed at home with supportive care like rest, fluids and over-the-counter pain relievers. ""If there's concern about the side effects or feeling bad for a day or two, what I recommend is to get the vaccine on a Friday or the weekend,"" says Mulligan. The good news? Although side effects can be unpleasant, they are actually a sign that the the body's immune system is responding and the vaccine is working, experts note. Since 2020, the cost of COVID vaccines was covered by the federal government, and every person in the U.S. was able to get jabbed for free regardless of insurance coverage.  When the federal public health emergency ended in May 2023, vaccine purchasing shifted to the private sector, Cohen noted. The updated vaccines will not be provided by the government — fortunately, the majority of Americans will still be able to get the shots for free,  . Most private and public insurance plans, including Medicare, will cover the cost of the updated vaccine, says Mulligan. However, people may need to visit an in-network provider to avoid out-of-pocket costs. Pfizer and Moderna have said they are pricing each vaccine dose at over $100,  .  If your health plan does not cover the cost of the vaccine, or you are one of the approximately 30 million uninsured Americans, there are still options. According to the CDC, these individuals can get a free vaccine at local health clinics, state, tribal, or territorial health departments and  . Barring the emergence of a significantly more contagious variant in the near future, the FDA said it anticipates that the COVID-19 vaccines will need to be updated annually. Just like the flu vaccine is tweaked every year to better match the strains expected to circulate that season, the COVID-19 vaccine will likely be reformulated to better match the new, mutated variants circulating, the experts note. While it's unclear how soon the vaccine will need to be reformulated, experts say COVID vaccines — and COVID — are here to stay. “I know folks are over COVID, and they want to leave it in the rearview mirror, but it’s here with us,"" Cohen said.

Recorded by mother Samantha Foss, the   shows her daughter, 8-year-old Freya, enjoying a burger in a car from California-based fast-food chain In-N-Out Burger. Based on her reaction, the little one’s taste buds reached a higher plane. On their shared account @ , the video has garnered over 10.4 million views since it was posted on Nov. 8. The start of the video shows Freya taking a bite of a  , Animal-Style, with no lettuce or tomato, from the chain. The delight on the second grader’s face says it all, with joy, contentment and pleasure washing over her face as she rolls her eyes and chomps away. “Get me a Double-Double-  next time,” Freya says after 10 full seconds of wordless mealtime bliss. After her mom repeats her request, Freya nods in confirmation. The little tyke then slaps the center console in exclamation, as if words could not express the euphoria she’s experiencing in that moment. In the comments section of the video, more than 10,000 people shared their thoughts on the girl’s passion for food. “I have now watched this 5x and laughed harder each time 😂, “ commented one TikTok user. “I understand this happiness completely,” wrote another TikToker. “Lmaoooo it’s the smack on the arm rest for me!” said another. “why is this not a commercial,” commented yet another TikToker, to which someone else replied, “I don’t even eat fast food and I want one 😋.” But the virality of Freya’s foodtime faces didn’t stop there. On Nov. 8, after Freya’s burger bliss started getting love on the platform, Foss  , this time at fast-casual pizza restaurant chain MOD Pizza.  Again, the first few seconds of the video are wordless, with Freya taking a bite of a pineapple and cheese pizza with a dab of pesto on top. After she takes a bite, she curtly says, “Mmm!” and throws her fork down onto the table like a football in the endzone. “What’s your problem?” asks an off-screen adult. “What’s my  ? It’s so good!” Freya replies, then stares at the question-asker in silence for 10 seconds as if to say, “Duh!” Although Freya garnered thousands of positive comments across multiple videos, there were some folks who expressed “concern” over what they called an “unhealthy mindset,” and even dared to call In-N-Out “garbage.” So, Freya took it upon herself to respond to those people. “You should let me enjoy my burgers,” Freya says in a Nov. 17 video. She brings her Apple Watch into view to show she’s also an active child — and she can be seen in other clips on her account   and  . “I close my rings every day. If you know you know.” For Foss, all the attention on her kiddo is delightfully unexpected but also makes total sense to her. “I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. It’s crazy,” Foss tells TODAY.com. “My husband and I were sitting in the car waiting to pick her up and we were having a grown-up conversation about life and bills and I wanted an instant serotonin boost, so I went to look at old videos of her and I came across that video. I was like, ‘This is so funny, the world needs to see this.’” For Freya, “It feels awesome and a little weird,” she says, adding that she has been reading the comments. “I’m aware … like, well, I’m actually going famous.” “I’m just grateful that people have been so positive,” Foss says of the comments section of both videos. “Freya is seeing that the world is so much bigger than we think it is, we can really make people smile and just bring a little bit of joy to their day.” When asked what her favorite food is, Freya says she can’t answer the question because she likes so many different foods. “​​I’m basically machinery. I just eat everything. Like a lot of things. I’ll ever not try something, you know?” Foss says that Freya loves variety, and has tried and enjoyed food items  wouldn’t even try. “She’s eaten chicken feet. We bury the pig and we cook the whole thing. She sees it from beginning to end,” Foss says, adding that Freya loves Cuban cuisine, thanks to her Cuban father. Freya then offers some advice for other kids who might be scared to try new things. “It’s crazy looking at something that you’ve just that you haven’t eaten before and you’re like, ‘Am I actually about to try that?’” she says. “Sometimes it looks so weird. But you gotta close your eyes and do it. You don’t know what you’re going to expect.” Washington, D.C. native Joseph Lamour is a lover of food: its past, its present and the science behind it. With food, you can bring opposites together to form a truly marvelous combination, and he strives to take that sentiment to heart in all that he does. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

After a mid-season breakup and makeup, Bliss and Zack made it to the show's finale, where they decided to tie the knot. This November, months after the show premiered in March 2023, Bliss and Zack announced they were expecting their first child. Bliss told People it was a ""nerve-wracking"" and ""beautiful thing."" Below, reminisce about how they go to this moment. The fourth season of the hit Netflix series began with Zack navigating a love triangle. He fell for both Bliss and Irina Solomonova in the pods. The 31-year-old lawyer ultimately decided to pursue his connection with Irina and ended his relationship with Bliss.  After Irina and Zack realized their relationship was not working,  . He rekindled his romance with Bliss and proposed to her in Episode Eight.  The 33-year-old program manager explained why decided to accept Zack’s proposal in a recent interview with  . She said the two had sparks when  .  After teasing Bliss and Zack’s wedding in the episode title, “Love Is Blind” showed their ceremony last.  When their portion begins, Bliss arrived at the wedding venue and said she was feeling “very nervous but excited.” Her friends and sister listened as she recalls the instant connection between her and Zack despite their brief breakup. Bliss said the initial separation made her question her faith in them, but she was happy they made it to their wedding day.  Zack sat down with his friends and explained a few of their similarities, like how he and Bliss both see themselves as owls. He also mentioned them being fans of Lee Ann Womack’s “I Hope You Dance.” When Zack’s friend Kenny asked why the lawyer chose Irina over Bliss at first, he revealed that he actually wanted to propose to Bliss in the pods.  He said an argument with Bliss about their different childhoods made him change his mind. “I didn’t know how her family was going to react to me. I felt like she had been dismissive to kind of what I was saying,” he explained.  Although he worried about them being raised differently, he overcame his fear and enjoyed meeting her parents.  Zack said he recognized the two have not known each other for very long. “But I think the reality is at some point you just gotta take the jump,” he said.  Meanwhile, Bliss told her wedding party that she trusts Zack and believes he will be honest when they are standing at the altar.  Zack was shown putting on his suit and his “B” cufflinks, in honor of his fiancée, before his grandmother and sister arrive. They comfort him as he mentioned how much he wished his mother, who passed away, could have attended his wedding. “I know she’s watching,” he said.  As Bliss’s dad, Shah, prepared to walk his daughter down the aisle, he offered her some advice. “Never settle. No matter what,” he said. Mom Katherine shared more reassuring words.  While reciting his vows, Zack said he first knew he loved Bliss when he told her goodbye. “It was when I said goodbye, that I knew what I had lost,” he said. “I felt it, but it was when you were gone that I knew I really loved you.” In return, Bliss praised Zack for how he sees the world. “You really believe in second chances. You believe in seeing the best in people,” she says, adding that his kindness makes him unique.  “I’d never met someone like you before. You are everything,” she said.  When it is time to reveal their answers, Zack said, “I love you so much, Bliss. I do.”  Bliss smiled and answered, “I do.”  Zack then kissed and dipped his bride as their friends and family applauded.  As their reception started, Womack’s ballad played in the background. Bliss and Zack glided around and touched foreheads during their first dance as husband and wife.   Bliss whispered, “I hope you dance,” repeating the song lyrics to her husband.  Before the episode ends, they both signed their marriage certificate and held it up for the cameras to see.  “You are the best wife ever,” Zack said.  Bliss told TODAY.com she knew that Zack was her person when they saw each other for the first time face-to-face.  “I didn’t come into it with any sort of expectation,” she shared. “I was willing to meet up with him because I felt like I could really trust this person.”  She added that they had an “intense chemistry” when they met. “I also really felt like I loved this person. I felt like this was my person,” she said.  Ariana Brockington is a trending news reporter at TODAY digital. She is based in Los Angeles. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/derek-jeter-fatherhood-perspective-rcna125854,Derek Jeter says becoming a dad put 'things in perspective',"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands If you’re a sports fan, you know the name Derek Jeter. And if you’re a Derek Jeter fan, you probably know he’s heavily involved in  , which he founded in 1996 to motivate young people to turn away from drugs and alcohol and “Turn 2” healthy lifestyles.  Jeter’s father, Dr. Charles Jeter, was a drug and alcohol abuse counselor who helped many people overcome substance abuse, inspiring Jeter to create the foundation with him. As part of his work with the foundation, the New York Yankees legend returned to his hometown of Kalamazoo, Michigan, earlier this month to unveil new baseball and softball fields for young athletes at Kalamazoo Central High School — a meaningful place where he grew his love for the game.  The new fields were made possible through his Turn 2 Foundation and Cal Ripken Jr.’s nonprofit,  . The two Baseball Hall of Famers celebrated the milestone with local students and community members during a special ribbon-cutting ceremony.  Jeter tells TODAY.com, “When I got a chance to come visit my family I said, you know, we have to renovate these fields. Because I grew up basically right next to them. I jumped the fence and would go to my high school fields to practice with my parents. And I said, ‘We need to renovate these fields.’  “So this has been a long, long process to get to where we are now,” he continued. “We actually would have done it a few years ago. But once again, COVID delayed things.” The new fields are just one of the many initiatives Jeter has pushed for in the nearly three decades the Turn 2 Foundation has existed. Although he was actively playing in the major leagues for most of that time, Jeter says he’s always been deeply involved in the organization, adding, “I wanted something that I could continue after my playing career.” Jeter is famously   and says that remains a focus of his community-oriented philanthropic efforts.  “I think when you play you have that platform … for me, for my family, our legacy is what we can do in the community. And we wanted to continue that post-playing career,” he says. “So it’s something that means a lot to me, it means a lot to my family. And we’ll continue it as long as we can get the support that we’ve gotten throughout the years, and we’ve been fortunate because we’ve gotten a lot of support.”  After retiring in 2014, Jeter dove right into new ventures. He co-founded   and was an executive with the Miami Marlins organization, where he hired   in the four major North American professional men’s sports leagues. Earlier this year he became a baseball analyst for Fox, and to the surprise and excitement of many, Jeter made his social media debut in May 2022 with the creation of his   and   accounts.  During his 20 years in the major leagues, Jeter was known as an extremely private and buttoned-up player. He never shared more than he wanted to, setting firm boundaries with the media. Because social media doesn’t seem like the place for someone who has spent most of their adulthood protecting their privacy, Jeter says he’s still figuring out what sides of himself he shares, on his own terms.  “It’s not the most comfortable. It doesn’t cross my mind on a daily basis (to) share something on social media. … I think it’s a great platform to share a lot of things that you’re doing, especially from a business standpoint ... but then I also understand people want to see another side of you.  ""So I wouldn’t say I’m comfortable by any stretch of the imagination, but I’m getting more comfortable.”  One area of his life in which Jeter is certainly comfortable is being a girl dad. In 2016, Jeter married Hannah Jeter (formerly Davis) and together they’ve welcomed four children: Bella Raine, 6; Story Grey; 4, River Rose, 1; and son Kaius,  Jeter says fatherhood “gives a new perspective on what’s most important.” He adds, “Through my career, I was always very selfish, because it was all about me. … And then once I retired and got married and had kids, it really put things in perspective.” He says, “Kids are leaders not only in their schools, but in their communities. And I think there’s just another level of importance that you realize, when you start having a family of your own.”  Even though his oldest daughter is only 6, Jeter says he's excited for the day she can be involved in the Turn 2 Foundation. What that involvement will look like, Jeter isn’t entirely sure, but he wants his kids to be able to have the same positive feelings that he experiences when he gives back to his community.  Jeter adds that he believes kids should experience that “as young as possible.” Lexy White, Social Media Producer © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

https://www.today.com/parents/parents/adoption-cost-rcna39872,How much does the average adoption cost? The answer might surprise you,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Discussing finances can be a little uncomfortable in general. Talking about costs in relation to adding a child to your family can feel completely taboo. But discussing finances, and finding out the average adoption costs in your area, is essential.  Leah Atkins, an interior designer in Lawrenceville, Georgia, had several serious health conditions that caused her and her husband to turn to   when they wanted to grow their family. The couple was astounded by the expense of the process. “We knew that it wasn’t cheap, but we had no idea just how   it truly was,” she said, citing legal fees as the most expensive percentage of the total cost for their two adoptions. Average adoption costs can vary greatly based on the type of adoption and circumstances around the adoption. If you are considering adopting a child, these are some of the costs you can expect so that you can begin planning for your family’s future.  “Researching the various types of adoption is an important part of beginning the adoption journey,” said Rita L. Soronen, president and CEO of the  .  There are three routes to adopting a child: “The costs of each kind of adoption differ widely. It is important to know that there are also many options for financial assistance for families hoping to adopt and that understanding these options can go a long way toward alleviating the worry about cost,” said Soronen. The average cost of adopting a child in the United States is between $20,000 and $45,000, says the   from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This price can cover legal fees, home studies, travel and lodging, court fees, and medical and living expenses for the birth parent.  Soronen said it’s important to get clarity from the adoption agency or the attorney involved on specific costs prior to making a commitment. Parents can expect a private adoption agency to be more expensive. However, some agencies will offer a sliding scale based on the adoptive parents’ income.  For an independent domestic adoption, parents find the birth mother without an agency and use an adoption lawyer to facilitate all of the legal aspects and paperwork. Costs can range from $15,000 to $40,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway. Adoption costs by state may differ since adoption laws vary state to state.  Depending on the country of adoption, international adoption costs will vary greatly. Parents should plan to pay between $20,000 and $50,000 for an international adoption, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway.  Be sure to budget for multiple trips to the country before and during the adoption process and add the extra expenses of travel and hotel costs.  Morgan Lampp and her wife, Mara Hill, dreamed of adopting a baby and were surprised to learn that in their home state of Florida, foster care adoption costs were extremely low.  “Through our adoption classes it was very clear that there would be little to nothing out of pocket with our adoption,” says Lampp. “The classes, home study, fingerprints and background checks — all covered. Even our lawyer costs for adoption were covered in full.”  While every state has different rules and fees associated with adoption through foster care and every case is different, for this couple, the process moved very quickly. “Last year we had our home study completed and within a month we were matched with our baby, Kai. She was officially adopted by us at the end of May,” said Hill. According to Soronen, here’s what prospective parents need to know about adoption through foster care: New parents Lampp and Hill said they hope adoption through foster care is an avenue that more parents will explore. “We encourage anyone interested in adopting because these children need a safe and loving environment, and a forever family. If money is something stopping you, know that this may be a route for you.” While the cost of adoption can be expensive, there are a variety of ways to save and pay for adoption, including: Even with careful planning, there may be additional fees and expenses that prospective parents should anticipate during the adoption process. “Depending on the circumstance and age of a child when adopted, there may be a need for post-adoption medical or mental health assistance,” said Soronen.   There may also be legal fees to consider. “Since adoption is a legal exchange, families may want to consider engaging an attorney, even if one is not required, to assure that all aspects of the adoption are handled appropriately.” “The adoption journey is one that, in the end, joyfully creates or expands a family and provides a child a permanent and loving home,” says Soronen. “Although costs can be a challenging part of that journey, there are multiple options and supports available.” Rosie Colosi lives in New Jersey and is a reporter for TODAY Parents.

It was that sort of thing.”  Cuoco and “Ozark” star Pelphrey met at the red carpet premiere of the Netflix drama in April 2022.

https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/best-christmas-movies-rcna48412,66 of the best Christmas movies to watch for instant holiday cheer,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands It's becoming that time of the year when there is no shame in watching a Christmas movie every day. Even if it's in between playing   each viewing of “Elf” or “Home Alone” never gets old and is a bridge back to what is often fond memories. With so many famous Christmas movies out there, the question is not when to start watching them (now!), but  movies to watch. TODAY.com gathered an array of options, ranging from family-friendly watches to holiday romances to old black-and-white classics to dysfunctional family comedies to Black Christmas movies to Christmas horror movies for adults. Also expect animated movies beyond ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" though that's on here, too.  Grab some eggnog and enjoy! Every attempt that Clark makes at increasing Christmas cheer in his family of Grinches backfires and ends up making things worse. Complete with power outages due to too many lights, canceled Christmas bonuses that were much needed and unexpected visitors just showing up, this comedy film is one for the ages. Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney star in this musical, which was nominated for an Oscar for the song ""Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep)."" Professional thieves Willie and Marcus annually rob shopping malls when they accept seasonal jobs as Santa Claus and his elf.

Dads Howard and Myron nearly come to blows (OK, they do) when they set out shopping on Christmas Eve for an action figure that their respective sons want. Through twists and turns, it gets to the point where the dads have dressed as the action figure and his archenemies and fight it out. In the end, they agree to a solution that they consider a win-win. ""Arthur Christmas"" is like the ""Love Actually"" of Christmas movies, in that it's  of British greats. The cast consists of James McAvoy, Hugh Laurie, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton, among others, helm the animated movie, which follows Santa's son Arthur trying to fix a present delivery gone awry. You can thank  for the classic song ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" Judy Garland stars in the period piece set in St. Louis before the World's Fair. The movie came out, however, amid World War II, giving the melancholy song extra resonance for people missing loved ones.  Watch ""The Princess Switch"" and then its two increasingly ridiculous (and fun) movies. Vanessa Hudgens plays identical women – of no relation. One is a baker from Chicago, the other is royalty in a small, fictional European country. They come together during the Christmas season and then decide to switch places, just for the thrill. With a title that pays homage to the  ,"" the film will keep you guessing and swooning until the very end. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding play a couple who fall in love during the holiday season — but there's something Golding's character isn't saying. Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard play angels who narrate the action of this moving Christmas romantic comedy, and sometimes intervene. Nancy (Gabrielle Union) puts her three children before herself, over and over. This Christmas,  gets to be the main character in her life, thanks to a bit of romance. Adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"" come up multiple times on this list — but the Carol in question in this Todd Haynes project is of another variety. Cate Blanchett plays a bored, wealthy New Jersey housewife in the 1950s who forms a connection — a  connection — with a department store clerk (Rooney Mara) while Christmas shopping. “Klaus” shows that, no matter how many Christmas movies there are, there’s  a chance to make something wholly original. With beautiful animation, this fairy tale reimagines Santa as a gruff woodworker. In the movie, a postal worker assigned to a far northern town befriends him, and they hatch a plan to deliver presents to the children of the community, divided by a petty rivalry.  Say you don't want a Christmas movie, but a movie that gets the stakes of the  — and what it's like to feel alone at a time of togetherness. ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is the  , teeming with ugly Christmas sweaters, genuine charm and unforgettable leading men. Scrooge is an incorrigibly grumpy old man. For him, Christmas is nothing but one long ""bah, humbug!"" Then, at an inflection point inspired by an employee and his struggling family, three ghosts convene to give Scrooge a change in attitude. Beyond this movie, the classic tale, first written by Charles Dickens, has been interpreted in Muppet movies, one-man shows and more.  Dolly Parton is one of the reigning queens of Christmas specials. In this made-for-TV movie from the '90s, she plays a country singer-turned-angel who, after her death, helps people down on Earth.  Yes, this   is grim — but it's also  a Christmas movie. The Pablo Larrain biopic imagines three days at the end of Princess Diana and the then Prince Charles' marriage, as they celebrated the holidays at Balmoral. If your days aren't feeling merry and bright, then this might be the movie for you. Joining a new family isn't easy, especially when they're the Stones. When Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) heads to her boyfriend's town for the holidays, she hopes for a warm reception and gets, instead, a new set of personalities (and challenges) to face. After decades of over-the-top celebrations, two empty nesters decide to skip Christmas and go on vacation instead — only to immediately backtrack when their daughter surprises them for the holiday. As Santa's son, Nick Kringle was groomed to take over the family business. The only issue? He doesn't much want it. At the start of this Disney+ original, Nick (Bill Hader) leaves the North Pole abruptly. His sister, Noelle (Anna Kendrick), is determined to find him and bring him back home in time for Christmas. Turns out the holidays are a stressful time for the Kringles, too. A TV executive (Alicia Witt) is busy working on Chritmas movies, but has none of the spirit herself. After an accident, she wakes up in a picture-perfect world much like the snowglobe she had  been playing with. Meg is cynical and thinks dreams do not come true, but this adventure (whether real or imagined) may help her change her tune. Santa is cooler than ever in this Netflix series, which stars couple  . In the first installment, two kids catch Santa in their house, so — naturally — they sneak onto his sleigh to leave with him, disrupting his process. The title event in ""Office Christmas Party"" will make or break tech company Zenotek in Chicago. It's facing closure and is trying to win over a new investor to stay afloat, but the investor wants proof it's a healthy company with happy workers. Zenotek throws a flamboyant office Christmas party to woo the investor — but everything ends up going wrong, of course. ""A Castle for Christmas"" is a romantic comedy starring Brooke Shields as romance author Sophie Brown and Cary Elwes as the Duke of Dunbar. Following a petit scandal, Sophie flees to Scotland to get in touch with her roots. While there, she visits a castle where her grandfather used to work, and ends up clashing (and having chemistry) with its aristocratic owner. ""A Boy Called Christmas"" is a fairy tale-infused take on the origins of Christmas. Come for the family-friendly, imaginative vibes that will make you long for a sleigh ride; stay for the performances by the all-star cast, including Sally Hawkins, Kristen Wiig, Jim Broadbent, Maggie Smith, Michiel Huisman and Henry Lawfull in the starring role. Jennifer (Tatyana Ali) manages to find time in her busy schedule to travel back home and visit her dad after he has a hard fall. While back home, she starts getting love letters from someone who died three years prior. Be careful what you wish for. The kids in ""Santa Hunters"" devise a scheme to get photographic proof that Santa exists — and it works. But then they learn that Santa loses some of his magic every time he's seen, so they set out to destroy all the evidence before Santa completely vanishes away. ""Ghost of Girlfriends Past"" is a rom-com version of ""A Christmas Carol."" Matthew McConaughey plays a committed bachelor haunted by the ""ghosts"" of his past — his ex-girlfriends. Their appearances might be enough to inspire him to change his ways. The daughter of a millionaire has her world shaken up in ""Christmas Inheritance."" She's living the high life in New York City, ready to take over her father's company, but has one last test to past: living in the middle of nowhere with limited resources. There, she gains a newfound appreciation for her privilege and a new perspective on life. It wouldn't be Christmas without ""Frozen,"" Disney's hit about sisterhood, magic and reindeer. While not holiday-themed, the wintery vibe fits the season. Princesses Anna (Kristin Bell) and Elsa ( ) were close as kids, but following the death of their parents, retreated into their own worlds — Elsa, alone with her magic, and Anna looking for a replacement. When a dashing prince comes to their remote kingdom, she thinks she's found one. In the end, Elsa and Anna's relationship is restored in an unconventional way, and a loveable snowman remains their best friend. Kate Stanton (Amy Smart) has 12 chances to get it right in romantic comedy ""12 Dates of Christmas.""

""The Search for Santa Paws"" is a family-fun comedy in which Santa and his pup travel to New York City to visit a friend, only Santa has an accident and ends up separated from his crew without any memories. Two of his elves leave the North Pole to look for him in New York in a nonlinear path full of adventure. Longstanding family traditions are put to the test in ""Soul Food"" when the family matriarch dies and her kids are left to keep things together. But, of course, their efforts are interrupted by arguments, work and other distractions they blame each other for. ""Soul Food"" is a classic family movie starring Nia Long, Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox and Mekhi Phifer. Kate Conrad (Kristin Davis) unexpectedly ends up divorced from her husband just before the Christmas season. She goes on a solo trip that they were supposed to take together and ends up starting over with someone new, pilot Derek (Rob Lowe), as they nurse back to health animals in the wild jungle. ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is a new — and by ""new"" we mean dreamy, ethereal and star-studded — spin on an old story. On Christmas Eve, a dad gifts his three children presents their deceased mother left them. One of the kids, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), gets a locked, egg-shaped box and spends the movie searching for the key to open it. What follows is a delight for the senses, just like the ballet (and real-life ballerina Misty Copeland makes an appearance). “Elf” is a classic starring Will Ferrell as Buddy, a human raised by Santa's elves. When he outgrows his world (literally), Buddy travels to New York to meet his biological father and get some answers. Leaving the North Pole is hard, but so is bringing its culture to the Big Apple. Buddy has to decide who he is in this new city. This classic Christmas rom-com starring Denzel Washington and the late Whitney Houston shows what can happen with a sprinkle of divine intervention. Houston plays Julia, the wife of a local pastor who is far too busy for her. Washington plays Dudley, an angel God sent to restore their marriage. Along the way, Dudley falls in love with Julia, which ironically ends up pushing the married couple back together. Christmas is a time for reuniting with old friends — including fictional ones. ""Best Man Holiday"" brings the cast of the 1999 movie ""Best Man"" back together. Secrets are uncovered and wounds are healed. Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Regina Hall, Terrence Howard, Sanaa Lathan, Nia Long, Harold Perrineau, Monica Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa all appear as their characters.  Living on opposite sides of the world, Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) need a change of scene, so they agree to a house swap. Amanda moves into Iris' English cottage; Iris moves into Amanda's LA pad. In new cities, they explore new adventures and, of course, new connections. ""The Mistle-tones: A Musical"" features a Christmas-themed pop group auditioning new members, but it rejects the late founder's daughter. So the daughter, Holly (Tia Mowry), looks for other opportunities to sing and becomes a rival of the pop group.  ""Let It Snow"" is a Christmas rom-com adapted from a book of the same title by Maureen Johnson. In the movie, a famous pop star and a good Samaritan he mistakes for a fan end up falling in love. As his family prepares for a Christmas vacation to Paris, Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) gets accidentally left behind. While home alone, Kevin outsmarts two criminals trying to ransack his family’s house. Kevin was initially criticized for his mischievousness — but it ultimately saves the day.  Based on the beloved Dr. Seuss children's books, ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a fan favorite to see. The Grinch (Jim Carrey) hates Christmas and vows to make it as miserable as possible for everyone else, so he steals all the presents throughout the city. But the town people celebrate Christmas anyway, and the Grinch realizes he could never stop Christmas ...  and doesn't want to anymore. If you're looking for something genuinely different, look no further: ""Jingle Jangle"" features gorgeous set design, a unique plot  original music. Jeronicus Jangle (Forest Whitaker) is a toy maker whose most famous designs were stolen by a former apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key). Jeronicus' long-lost granddaughter is on a mission to get his work back. ""Holiday Inn"" is an oldie but a goodie.

The trio performed singing and dancing acts together before the drama and find a turbulent way to keep the act going at Jim's new place. ""So This Is Christmas"" is a coming-of-age story for a teenager (Lexi Ainsworth) headed in the wrong direction. To get back on track, she volunteers for a local Christmas play for children and has her eyes opened to being more grateful and humble. The late Anne Heche plays a recently divorced mom trying to make the first holiday without dad as special as it can be. For all her good intentions, the many hiccups threaten the Christmas celebration altogether. ""A Bad Moms Christmas"" gives the four mothers from the original movie a taste of their own medicine when their mothers visit for Christmas. Suddenly, the group's raucous approach to parenting makes sense. Everyone remembers the best Christmas they ever had. In ""A Christmas Story,"" a grown-up Ralphie tells the story of his, and it involves a BB gun and a very famous leg lamp. The Christmas comedy loosely based on two books by Jean Shepherd, ""In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash"" and ""Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.""  The far-flung Rodriguez family gathers in their family's Chicago home for the holidays. The adult children think they'll encounter the usual drama, but get a whole lot more. The movie stars Alfred Molina, John Leguizamo and more.  George Bailey (James Stewart) is battling himself in ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" Frank Capra's Christmas masterpiece. An angel named Clarence shows him what a different place the world would be if he wasn't in it, giving him the perspective he was missing: He matters. Life-affirming and faith in humanity-restoring, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" might give you a perspective shift, too.   ""Deck the Halls"" is a family comedy movie in which passive aggressive neighbors end up in a house decorating competition. Locked in a kind of suburban war, they pull out all the stops: Santas on sleighs, reindeers in snow and lights on every corner. The film stars Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito. Some may say ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a  , not a Christmas movie — but  say it can be both. The Tim Burton film follows Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of a Halloween-themed town. Grown tired of scaring, he lands in nearby Christmastown, but brings some of his mischief with him. He plots to kidnap Santa Claus and assume his role for unfettered access to new scare victims. Sibling rivalries are on full display in ""This Christmas"" when the Whitfield Family gathers for their annual Christmas fest, toting the secrets that will eventually be revealed. The film stars Idris Elba, Loretta Devine, Regina King, Lauren London, Delroy Lindo and Chris Brown.  Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) is a reserved, cautious sales clerk in ""Last Holiday"" who moves across the globe for a new adventure after receiving some life changing news. The movie stars LL Cool J, Giancarlo Esposito and Timothy Hutton, and a young Chloe and Halle Bailey. ""Polar Express"" is follows a group of kids on a train to the North Pole for a special visit. The journey teaches the kids about the magic of the holiday season, when anything is possible. It's an adventure they'll never forget, and neither will you.  Poor grandma! She literally  mowed own by a reindeer while walking home one evening (or so they think). The incident turns into a court trial against the reindeer, but her grandson finds a way to prove them innocent and uncover who was actually responsible for the accident. ""Thumpity, thump thump"" along with ""Frosty the Snowman"" as the lovable titular character and his friends try to find a way to keep him alive after temperatures start to rise and the magic hat that brought him to life is at risk of being stolen. The title of ""Happiest Season"" is misleading. It's not  the happiest season for Abby (Kristen Stewart) and her girlfriend Harper (Mackenzie Davis). How come? Because Harper's parents don't know she's in a relationship with a woman, and Abby doesn't know if she can't date someone who won't come out of the closet.  ""Black Nativity"" is an intergenerational musical drama about a teenager being sent to spend the holidays with his pastor grandparents and their strict rules. The journey teaches him faith and the power of healing and family. The star-studded cast includes Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Jennifer Hudson and Jacob Latimore. Let's collect  the ""Christmas Carol"" movie remakes, shall we? ""A Christmas Carol"" is an animated version featuring the voice of Jim Carrey, who also plays the Scrooge-like main character of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""  The Meyer family is having their first Christmas get-together after their matriarch died the year before. Walter Meyer (Danny Glover) invites his four adult children home for Christmas only to find their bickering is the most spirited moment of all. He decides the new goal, instead of  , is to simply make it under the same roof for five days. Prison fugitives hide out in a local shop they plan to rob in ""We're No Angels."" But then the next day is Christmas and the shop's owners invited them to stay for dinner. The experience changes the fugitives' outlooks on life to the point they start doing good deeds around the town to raise money for the financial hole they learn the owners are in. ""Love Actually"" lays out nine intertwined stories that offer an authentic look at what love is, actually. A cultural mainstay, the love stories remain conversation starters. In case you need a refresh, Hugh Grant plays the prime minister falling for a junior staffer; Colin Firth is a writer who has a connection with the Portuguese woman hired to clean his cottage; and Laura Linney is a graphic designer whose love life is derailed whenever her sick brother needs something.  The song goes, ""May your days be merry and bright."" But if they're  , then a   might hit the spot. Just as winter break is set to start, a group of sorority sisters in horror film ""Black Christmas"" begin to receive anonymous, lascivious phone calls. When one of the women goes missing, they realize these aren't just phone calls — they're threats, and the culprit is closer than expected. Turn to a   and Robert Mitchum. In ""Holiday Affair,"" a charming department store clerk catches a shopper in a fraudulent scheme. This is a rom-com, so don't worry: Law enforcement doesn't swoop in. After learning Connie is a war widow and single mom, Steve takes pity on her and begins to learn about her — and likes what he finds out. The family matriarch in this French film, earns she has leukemia, so she asks her family at the Christmas gathering to see if they are eligible bone marrow donors. Her potential death sets off a string of arguments and friction between her kids who are not ready to say goodbye. Christmas horror movie “Jack Frost” shows how a convicted killer literally becomes a snowman. As reports of a snowman killing people make the rounds in Snowmonton, there are still people trying to celebrate the holiday amid the danger. It’s a story featuring both cheers and screams.

https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/mom-38-announces-own-death-ovarian-cancer-rcna125564,"Mom, 38, announces her own death from ovarian cancer, goes viral for last wish","Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Casey McIntyre wanted her friends and loved ones to hear about her death directly from her, and on her own terms, her husband says. So on Tuesday, Nov. 14, that’s exactly how it happened. “A note to my friends: if you’re reading this I have passed away. I’m so sorry, it’s horse (expletive) and we both know it. The cause was stage four ovarian cancer,” a   posted to McIntyre’s X account read. “I loved each and every one of you with my whole heart and I promise you, I knew how deeply I was loved.” McIntyre was 38. She leaves behind her husband, Andrew Rose Gregory, and their 18-month-old daughter, Grace. The family lives in New York City, where she worked as a book publisher. The young mom’s death and candid message has received widespread attention on social media, as has her wish to erase other people’s medical debt through donations made to the charity RIP Medical Debt.  The nonprofit uses the donated money to buy and pay off medical bills owed by low-income Americans. More than $572,000 was raised for a   by Tuesday, Nov. 21, making it one of the most successful individual campaigns in the charity's history, RIP Medical Debt announced on its Instagram page. The charity called McIntyre a ""beacon of compassion"" and said it was deeply moved by her ""incredible impact."" “I am so lucky to have had access to the best medical care,” she wrote in her final message, “and am keenly aware that so many in our country don’t have access to good care.” McIntyre was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2019 after complaining of swelling of her abdomen, her husband says. It turned out to be severe  , or the build-up of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and the organs, according to the National Library of Medicine. More than one-third of women with ovarian cancer develop ascites, the   notes. McIntyre underwent chemotherapies, surgeries and some experimental immunotherapies. “I will just assure you that she tried everything for me, her daughter and her family,” Gregory, 41, tells TODAY.com via email. “She re-entered treatment in September 2021 after 18 months of no evidence of disease and was released into home hospice in June 2023. We were fortunate to have one last bonus summer together.” McIntyre did not have   that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, he adds. The couple, who  , had planned the “medical debt jubilee” as part of her memorial when it seemed she was going to die in May. “I am happy we were able to postpone it six months,” Gregory notes. Her memorial will now take place in December. He says that as his wife’s friends and loved ones mourn her, they can also take comfort in knowing they helped destroy medical debt for people in need thanks to her last wish. “I am struggling to live my life without my wife who I purely adored, but Casey suffered so much in the last years and especially last weeks of her life,” Gregory says.  “Ovarian cancer is crueler than you can imagine. In her last days we were all able to tell her, ‘Casey, you have done it all. The race is swum. Find rest, find peace, be free.’” Only about 20% of ovarian cancers are found early, according to the  , mainly because the symptoms can be vague. The   include: Besides inherited genetic mutations,   include getting older, having obesity, having children for the first time after age 35 or never giving birth, taking hormone therapy after menopause; and having a family history of ovarian, breast or colorectal cancer. There’s no routine screening for ovarian cancer and no early detection test.  The   can detect high levels of certain tumor markers that are often found in women who have ovarian cancer, the National Library of Medicine notes. But the test isn’t ordered during routine checkups for women because it’s very non-specific, Dr. Jason Wright, chief of gynecologic oncology at Columbia University in New York,  . “Any type of inflammation, any type of infection, things like fibroids, endometriosis, all of those things can cause an elevation in CA-125 levels,” he noted. Regular pelvic exams may help with detection because an OB-GYN can feel a mass on an ovary, but often the cancer has already spread by that point, Wright said. Another tool to find tumors is a transvaginal ultrasound. Because the warning signs are “very vague,” women have to be their own advocates, Wright advised. If the symptoms persist, get worse or aren’t getting better with other treatments, women should raise the possibility of ovarian cancer with their doctor, he noted. A.

https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologists-favorite-thanksgiving-foods-rcna126136,5 foods cardiologists avoid on Thanksgiving and what they eat instead,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Thanksgiving dinner can make your heart beat faster with delight at the sight of all the delicious roast turkey, side dishes and desserts. But what does the feast — with all of its fat, salt, meat, sugar and alcohol — actually do to your heart health? Ask cardiologists what they eat for Thanksgiving and two camps emerge. Some are horrified by the   and choose a different menu for their own family. “If you look at the purpose of holidays, we’re really trying to celebrate life. And yet, we sit down together with people and poison each other. This is something we really need to fix,” Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, tells TODAY.com. He doesn’t eat turkey or any animal-based proteins anymore, making squash stuffed with quinoa, beans and spices as his main course on Thanksgiving. But the other camp of heart doctors believes it’s important to enjoy the holiday along with its  . “I’m probably not a typical cardiologist. I eat everything for Thanksgiving,” says Dr. Marc Eisenberg, a clinical cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York. “If you deprive yourself for Thanksgiving, then likely the next day or the day after, you’re just going to binge eat everything you feel like you missed out on. I tell most people: Just enjoy yourself.” It’s one day out of the year, so Dr. Sean Heffron, a cardiologist in the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Health in New York, says he allows himself some freedom. “(But) don’t make it six weeks out of the year, which is what many people do from Thanksgiving all the way to New Year’s and it’s easy to do,” he warns. There are also some important caveats for people with  . Here’s what heart doctors will eat this Thursday, and the foods and drinks they avoid: Dr. Susan Cheng, a cardiologist in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, eats a mostly  , but she’ll eat a little turkey surrounded by many vegetable side dishes such as a sweet potatoes, butternut squash or salad greens. “Portion control is huge because eating beyond what we need at any given situation, particularly for one meal, tends to overload the system,” she says. Instead of having a giant piece of turkey, it’s better to have lots of spinach or broccoli and a little taste of the meat on the side, Freeman advises. He loves green beans and potatoes, but urges people to avoid covering their favorite vegetables in oil and butter. “Sometimes you see people take 2 pounds of turkey on their plate and they have like a piece of broccoli,” he notes. “It just blows my mind.” Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist and clinical associate professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, tries to make her Thanksgiving dinner less carb-heavy by serving lots of salad and vegetables. An   is a great way to take fingerling potatoes and make them crispy and surprisingly tasty, Freeman says. He also likes to crisp up fresh Brussels sprouts in an air fryer, then top them with a balsamic vinegar glaze. Fruit was a popular option for dessert among the cardiologists. Goldberg advises making “a beautifully colorful fruit salad.” She also likes serving an assortment of mini pastries instead of large pies. It’s also a great opportunity to make cranberry or banana breads that contain simple ingredients and are delicious and moist, Freeman adds. Some store-bought pies can also work because they’re “accidentally plant-based,” meaning they contain no milk, butter or cream, so check the ingredient list, he advises. The skin of an animal is typically very high in fat and calories, Freeman says. “I would never recommend turkey skin in general,” he notes. Heffron also recommends removing the skin and focusing on the white meat breast pieces, which  . All of the cardiologists say they’d skip the butter because of all the animal fat and cholesterol it contains. They urge people to look for ways to reduce or eliminate it in recipes. “Butter is probably the worst thing people can eat,” Eisenberg warns. “Butter is used in excess in many situations where you often don’t need as much to get the quality taste of the meal,” Cheng adds. Heffron says he’s modified his grandmother’s stuffing recipe to include no butter, and it doesn’t taste all that much different. Traditional gravy is just added fats and calories, Heffron notes. Drizzled   could be better, along with some nuts sprinkled on food to add some texture, he adds. “You can make a delicious gravy out of mushrooms and flour. But if you’re starting to add heavy cream, milk and butter and eggs … it really loads up on calories, saturated fat, cholesterol,” Freeman warns. “These are things that can potentially lead to atherosclerosis down the road.” People with high blood pressure, heart disease or kidney disease need to be careful about their salt intake, Eisenberg says. Unfortunately, the typical Thanksgiving feast is loaded with salt, even plain turkey meat. Most store-bought turkeys have been brined for days, meaning they’re soaked in salt water for juiciness — some are even injected with salt water for the same purpose, Freeman points out.  Americans already   every day, but on Thanksgiving, it can be several times the amount they should eat in a day, he adds. If you’re making things from scratch, add salt at the very end of the cooking process, which often results in adding less salt overall, Cheng advises. Skip the “fancy” coarse salt, which delivers a much larger volume of salt for the amount of taste you get, she adds. The doctors say they may have just a little taste of wine or just skip alcohol altogether. One to two drinks is generally fine, just don’t overdo it, Eisenberg warns. “People have to watch out because alcohol can raise your blood pressure; it can also put people in abnormal heart rhythms,” he notes. Traditional eggnog contains lots of calories, fat and added sugar, so it’s best to limit this holiday drink, Freeman says. Here’s more advice from the cardiologists about taking care of your heart this holiday: A. Pawlowski is a TODAY health reporter focusing on health news and features.

https://www.today.com/food/thanksgiving-cocktails-t269754,35 Thanksgiving cocktails to make your feast a party,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Cheers to a happy  ! The holiday season is finally here, and what better way to celebrate than with a festive, seasonal cocktail or nonalcoholic beverage? Thanksgiving might be a holiday synonymous with feasting, but drinks are a big part of the festivities, too. After all, you’ll need something refreshing to wash down all those rich dishes. Plus, many of the traditional ingredients that appear on the holiday table also make delicious additions to drinks. Cranberries, apples, cinnamon, rosemary, oranges and pomegranate seeds are great for adding to beverages that will perfectly complement the main meal. Sharing drinks with guests is not only fun, but it also serves a purpose. Sipping a pre-dinner drink can help prep the palate and pique the appetite before a big feast. It's also a great way to unwind and can help digest once the meal is done. Plus, pairing a cocktail with dinner that perfectly pairs with the food makes any meal more enjoyable. And, of course, with a house full of friends and family, the relaxing effects of alcohol (in moderation!) can help take the edge off the stress of the holiday and hosting. Popping the cork on a bottle of wine is always a good way to start a get-together, but to make Thanksgiving extra special, shake up an ice-cold cranberry martini, stir up some spiked apple cider, mix up a big batch of seasonal sangria or blend up something creamy and comforting. With these autumn-inspired libations, there’s something for everyone — and many of them can easily be made alcohol-free. This is a very inclusive beverage because you serve the vodka on the side, so everyone gets to be in control of their alcohol consumption. We love doing a punch like this because you don't get stuck being the bartender all night for your guests. You get to enjoy the party and take credit for a great drink. Give margaritas an autumnal twist with apple cider, fresh apples and crushed graham crackers. Because tequila belongs on the Thanksgiving table. Having a pitcher of sangria at the dinner table on Thanksgiving is such a fun way to enjoy the holiday. It also something a little different from the traditional bottle of wine, but still features the familiar flavors. The espresso martini is one of the hottest drinks across the world. Here, we're giving it a fall-themed twist with pumpkin-flavored whipped cream. It's the perfect ending to Thanksgiving festivities. Who knew all the flavors of the holidays could fit into one glass? Tart cranberry, juicy orange and warm ginger come together to create the most festive sipper. To make it nonalcoholic, substitute the gin with extra ginger beer or club soda. ""For as long as I can remember my mom was blending away during the holidays, creating her famous Brandy Alexander cocktails,"" says Carson. ""It's such a tradition that we even named our family dog after the drink, calling her 'Lexi' for short. She was an off-white fluffy thing (resembling the concoction of cream and cocoa) and had a sprinkle of brown on her face that matched the tap of nutmeg that tops the blended beauty."" There's nothing better on a crisp, fall day — particularly Thanksgiving — than a warm, cozy drink. Most people turn to ciders or hot toddies, but this is a fun and festive change from the norm that might just become a new holiday favorite. This holiday helper is so festive and delightful, you'll be sipping in finesse all evening long. Without a drop of simple syrup or added sugar, plus a dose of antioxidants, this cocktail boasts boozy benefits (try saying that ten times fast). This seasonal sip is a lovely, crisp pour for breakfast or lunch, but once spiked and served warm, it becomes the ideal nighttime cocktail for fall. Warm cocktails are perfect for chilly days, and cider is a great vehicle for many spirits including bourbon, rum and vodka. Pour a few mugs on any cool fall eve or enjoy it with friends and family for the holidays. This drink looks and feels super festive for the holidays with very little effort. Start with a bottle of bubbles (preferably a dry prosecco or Champagne), add cranberry juice and pomegranate juice, give it a stir and top with a sprig of rosemary and fresh cranberries. It's both beautiful to look at and delicious to drink. Pro tip: Clap the rosemary between your hands to release the natural oils in the rosemary so your drink has a woodsy scent when sipped. Apple cider, warm winter spices like cinnamon and clove, fresh mint and limes add a seasonal twist on the mojitos that so often fills glasses throughout the sweltering summer months. It's a lovely way to help the frigid months go by! Use a spiced rum for additional warm flavors. Thanksgiving is the perfect gathering to put together a big batch drink. Seasonal sangria can be made with fall fruits like apples and pears and even clementines. A mix of fruits creates a pitcher perfect for a centerpiece and makes a warm welcome for your thirsty guests. The key parts to sangria are the fruit, a spirit, a sweet element and the wine. However, there is lots of room to play and create one that perfectly suits your taste and your menu. In this recipe spiced honey syrup takes the place of the sugar that appears in traditional sangria, and a neutral spirit like vodka replaces the standard brandy. Thanksgiving is a perfect time sip a little spritz. This sangria gets a festive makeover with sparkling wine. Turn leftover cranberry sauce into a flavorful fall cocktail! The fragrant gin and fresh mint play perfectly with the sweetness of the cranberry and orange. Any type of cranberry sauce will work, but something with added spices — like my   — will make this drink even more flavorful and nuanced. Celebrate any fall holiday or occasion with these sweet and spiced martinis. The pumpkin pie spice and vanilla vodka add the perfect seasonal touch to these festive cocktails. Forget your average hot cider and try this ultra-creamy and slightly spicy version. The fresh ginger syrup is equal parts pressed ginger juice and simple syrup (made by boiling one cup of water with one cup of sugar). It adds a sweet heat to the drink that's incredibly warming. Ina Garten makes these delicious cranberry martinis for the holidays. ""They look so festive, and my guests love them!"" she says. ""Infuse the vodka with the orange zest and cranberries at least two days ahead. I like to use a vegetable peeler to make strips of orange zest — it's so easy. Best of all, you can prepare the entire cocktail mixture and refrigerate it for up to three days. Just shake with ice before serving."" Featuring wine, cider and whiskey, this big-batch drink can be made ahead so the host isn't not stuck on bartending duty during the party. It's got big, apple-forward flavor thanks to apple brandy, apple cider and fresh apples. Bright citrus and whiskey help temper the sweetness and balance the drink beautifully. Pitcher drinks are perfect when entertaining, as they alleviate the stress of getting multiple drinks prepared and served as visitors descend upon the party. To make this drink nonalcoholic, simply swap the vodka for an equal part of club soda. Frozen cranberries make this cocktail look super seasonal and festive. Make two pitchers because it always seems to go too fast! Gather, be grateful and enjoy the ease of entertaining with this pretty pitcher drink. This is the easiest slow-cooker mulled wine ever. 'Tis the season for mulled wine, and the best part about it — besides that it's delicious — is that it's so simple to make. All you need equipment-wise is a slow cooker or a pot and a ladle. Like any other cocktail, you can put your personal spin on this recipe with additions of sweeter ingredients like apple cider or pear nectar or spice it up with fresh sliced ginger or cloves. This super easy mulled wine is a surefire holiday party and wintertime win and requires little to no kitchen savvy to succeed. Simply add your ingredients, heat and serve. With fall comes cooler evenings and earlier sunsets, but by no means should you pack up your refreshing drinks and hunker down for the winter already. Gin and tonics are indeed the perfect summer sip, and with a few tweaks, can easily become the perfect fall cocktail. Rosemary is a hearty herb that, in certain parts of the country, can be found all year round. As cilantro and mint go to seed and parsley and basil are harvested for pesto and chimichurri, bright green sprigs of rosemary can still be found to snip for a refreshing and herbaceous cocktail. Pour up one of these fizzy gin drinks for a lovely fall happy hour. Meet one of our favorite holiday cocktails: the cranberry-rosemary mule. ""Now, I almost never drink, but sometimes I create a cocktail that is so good that I even drink it!"" says Anthony Contrino. ""I created this for a dinner party, and I couldn't make them fast enough."" If you're craving chocolate, then this will satisfy your sweet tooth. This drink is great as the grand finale of dinner instead of dessert. Gently rubbing the rim of the glass with orange peel and squeezing the peel over the glass will activate the aroma for the nose and orange essence on the rim for your lips to enjoy. Keeping a bag of frozen cranberries in the house is a lifesaver during the holiday season. The fastest and easiest way to infuse holiday spirit into any drink, appetizer and even entrée is to sprinkle a few of these perfect pretty red berries on top. Just add a couple of frozen cranberries to your glass of water and — voila! — your pour is instantly camera-ready. Fall is in full swing and that means pomegranates are showing up everywhere. From food magazine covers sprinkled with the gorgeous little rubies, to home décor mags showing them off as everything from centerpieces to front door wreaths, pomegranates are a sure sign that the holidays are on the horizon. Before the holiday insanity really kicks in, try pouring up one of these delicious drinks. Here's to fall, pomegranates and a no-fuss cocktail anyone can make. Sorry, summer: Fall is taking over as the season for sangria. Apples, cider and bourbon give this cocktail a distinctively autumnal essence. Sparkling wine adds effervescence and makes it perfect to serve for Thanksgiving. Enjoy all the sweet and spiced goodness of pumpkin pie in one tasty sip. These shots are perfect for any fall celebration. It's like having dessert and a cocktail in one! This is the perfect aperitif for Thanksgiving. Anyone (of legal drinking age) who loves Italian cuisine or culture has to try this classic cocktail. A Negroni is best known for its delicate balance of bitter, citrusy and sweet flavors. Paired with some olives, it's the perfect pre-dinner drink. This cocktail from Siri Daly is vibrant, fresh and slightly sweet. The rosemary offers an earthy undertone and also makes it incredibly festive for the holidays. Making homemade simple syrup couldn't be easier, and infusing it with ingredients such as rosemary is such an easy technique to enhance the flavor of any cocktail. The greyhound, a time-tested mix of grapefruit juice and vodka, is a light, bright cocktail that fits in just as perfectly at a sunny day grill out as it does at a holiday party. Citrus is particularly good in the winter and the addition of rosemary-infused simple syrup plays up this cocktail's warm, sultry side. This classic, sit-down beverage is meant to be sipped, especially as a cold-weather drink. Its quintessential citrusy burst will complement all the rich food on the table. The cinnamon stick gives this classic holiday libation its signature flavor. Adding fresh ginger to the mix just takes this warming drink to the next level. It's warming and wonderful for any cold winter's night. This ginger spice apple cider cocktail recipe can be made in single servings (for a smaller crew) or scaled to make punch (for a big crowd). Just be sure to use 1 part bourbon to 5 parts apple cider (not apple juice!). Together, tequila and coffee provide a vibrant pick-me-up at the end of your meal. The combination is spicy and invigorating. Serve with three coffee beans for good health, wealth and love. Bubbles aren't just for Champagne and seltzer. This drink is inspired by the beautiful wreaths decorating the shopfronts of New York City during the holidays. It will wake up your palate with the fiery kick of ginger. Cozy and warming, spiced apple cider is the ultimate cold weather beverage to warm up the whole family. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Jason and Travis Kelce have come a long from from their upbringing in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and are now veritable NFL stars with Super Bowl rings — Jason Kelce won a Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2017; Travis Kelce in 2019 and 2023. But what, exactly, is fueling the hype? Here's everything you need to know about the first brothers of football.  Donna and Ed Kelce, Travis and Jason Kelce's parents, have opened up multiple times about their marriage.  In the ""Kelce"" documentary, focused on Jason Kelce and his family, Ed Kelce said he and Donna Kelce stayed together for their sons. “If we had split as we probably both would have preferred, that would have been a nightmare with the logistics, getting kids where they had to be and providing all the support,” Ed Kelce said in “Kelce"".  Donna Kelce said,  , that the two remain amicable “I don’t hate him. We’re friends to this day. We get along great,” she said. Before they were Eagles and Chiefs, they were Bearcats. While attending the University of Cincinnati, Jason and Travis Kelce briefly overlapped and    They also  together. Jason Kelce appeared on the Mythical Kitchen YouTube show in April 2023 and recounted how they ended up living with two queen beds in a shared dorm room.  When Travis Kelce tested positive for marijuana and got suspended from the team, Jason Kelce had him move in with him to ""keep an eye"" on his whereabouts. The room was ""not pristine,"" he said. “In the same time period, he had the audacity to kind of go back the other way again,” Jason Kelce said said. “I was so mad I punched the wall, and when I punched the wall my arm went through one piece of drywall, through the insulation, and then through the other side of the wall. So, there was just a big hole from the living room to the bathroom for like the rest of the quarter.” During the NFL season, the Kelce brothers  called  ,"" where they discuss everything from   to their personal lives (and, of course, football).

Travis Kelce said his brother ""paved the way"" for him in the same interview. “I can’t think him enough for doing that. I just hope he stays as happy as he is right now and that that never changes for him and that he only wins one Super Bowl and that I win the rest,"" he said.  The Kelce brothers and their teams went head to head at the 2023 Super Bowl. Donna Kelce, the  , spoke to   beforehand to discuss the dynamic of having two sons on opposite sides of the big game. She joked she was rooting for the “offense,” since both of her sons play offense. “I think that Jason would say I am going to root for the baby of the family, which is Travis. And I keep trying to tell him, ‘No, you’ve given me grandchildren,’ so we’ll leave it at that,” she then teased. During an interview with NFL films before the 2023 Super Bowl, Jason Kelce said he's proud of his younger brother's accomplishments.  “Seeing him turn into the player and the man that he is has been just the ultimate feeling of being proud,” he added.  Later on in 2023, and amid his headline-making romance with Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce was featured in the  His older brother Jason Kelce offered the following description of the tight end. ""He just lives his life with so much joy,” he said. ""He’s always kind of surrounding himself with people who are funny, who have a zest for life; it’s one of the things that defines him.""

His older brother  on the matter in an interview with . “This is another level of stardom that typically football players don’t deal with,” he said.  Jason Kelce then explained that he's cautiously supportive of his brother's relationship. “On one hand, I’m happy for my brother that he seems to be in a relationship that he’s excited about, that he is genuine about,” he said. “But there’s another end of it where it’s like, ‘Man, this is a lot.’ There’s paparazzi talking about him fueling his car before the game today and I’m like, ‘Is that really necessary information to share?’” The  , that the NFL was ""overdoing it"" in its coverage of Taylor Swift, especially when it came to her appearances at Travis Kelce's games. “They’re overdoing it,” Jason Kelce said, which his brother replied: “They’re overdoing it a little bit, especially with my situation.” The league also mentioned Swift in its social media accounts for a time. In  , the NFL said in part, “We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what’s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally. The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we’ve leaned into in real time, as it’s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.""

Not only because my   falls during this time, but also because it means temperatures are starting to cool and I get to break out my   collection.  While I'm a fan of many things about summer — like the cute   and  or the late sunset times — there's nothing like a crisp 65 degree day with a slight breeze in the air.  Despite having an absurd amount of sweaters already, I'm always on the hunt for a new one to add to my collection, and I just found my new favorite  .  The first thing I noticed when I slipped this   on was how soft it felt. It's always a gamble when ordering clothes online and there's nothing worse than loving a style, then when you finally get it, you put it on — and it's itchy. Luckily, this one didn't disappoint. ""Oversized"" might seem like a universal term, but there are definitely levels to it. Some styles say they're oversized, so you order your regular size and they fit normally — meaning you should've sized up to actually get the effect. Then there are other styles that claim to be oversized and are   bigger than you wanted, even when you order your usual size, so you end up looking larger than you are in them. This sweater was the perfect balance. I ordered my normal size (XL) and it was both long and flowy enough to have the right oversized feel. I also think it goes with anything, and not because it comes in over 30 colors. It's perfect to wear to work   and sneakers, like I did. Or it can be easily dressed up with slacks and heels. Also, it's so soft that it can even be worn with leggings to lounge around the house!  I wore this on one of the last days of August (aka basically one of the last days of summer), and while I was feeling all of the fall vibes, the temperature wasn't exactly on my side. It was much hotter than I anticipated, so I broke quite a sweat. But that made me confident that it'll be perfect for keeping me warm when fall temperatures actually get here and through winter. That being said, I'm excited to finally be able to make this a part of my weekly wardrobe! © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

More than 12,000 verified reviewers have given this top a five-star rating. ""If you’re looking for something cute to wear with a pair jeans, this is definitely the shirt to get,"" one reviewer wrote. However, we think you can also pair it with leggings if you don't want to compromise comfort for style. If you live in an area where the temperatures never truly plummet, a twisted tee is an easy top to style during the fall (and sometimes winter). Layer a cardigan over it and pair with jeans and knee-high boots for an effortless look. Since it's a cropped style, some reviewers note that it's perfect for wearing with high-waisted bottoms or a long skirt. Chiffon sleeves make this blouse feel extra stylish, and reviewers love that the fabric is soft, too. It comes in several different colors that work for any season and is available in sizes S-XXL. Since the bottom is banded, it pairs well with jeans or can be worn tucked into a skirt. This button-down can easily be transitioned from season to season. Whether you're headed to brunch or need a new top for the office (it pairs great with a blazer, according to one reviewer), this is the top to add to your cart. Tuck this blouse into high-waisted pants for a night out or let it drape over your favorite pair of skinny jeans for weekend brunch. Either way, reviewers say it is sure to become a wardrobe staple.

He’s a good person and I love him,” Ballinger said in her video. “We have always had a very rocky relationship since the beginning. We’ve always butted heads. We’ve always fought, ever since we met really. It’s never been a perfect relationship.” Ballinger married actor Erik Stocklin in 2018, and they share three children: Flynn Timothy, who turns 3 on Dec. 10, and 2-year-old twins Maisy Jo and Wesley.  She and Stocklin previously co-hosted a podcast, “Relax!

McIntyre, who was 17 when he shared this video, said Ballinger had previously sent him underwear as a joke, and shared “private details"" with him about her divorce and beyond.  In another YouTube video  , McIntyre summarizes it as following: “From the ages of 14 to 17 I helped this woman through so much, whether she’ll want to admit that or not — talked her through her divorce, talked her through YouTube cancellations."" He said he “thought” he had “formed a friendship” with her. Ballinger responded to McIntyre’s accusations in a  . She specifically addressed his claim that she had sent him underwear, saying that while this did happen, the situation was taken out of context.  “I’ve always given out weird, random things in livestreams,” Ballinger said. “And so in my mind at the time, this was no different than all the weird stuff I send to my fans as a joke. Now, in hindsight, I see how completely stupid of me — I should never have sent that.” “I should have realized and recognized how dumb that was, and never sent it to him no matter how much he asked,” she also said. “But it was never a sneaky, creepy, gross thing I was doing in secret. It was a silly, stupid mistake that now is being blown way out of proportion.” Ballinger has also been accused of interacting inappropriately onstage with a 16-year-old fan during a 2018 show in Philadelphia. The fan, identified as Becky in   earlier this year, claims Ballinger invited her onstage during the show to participate in a yoga challenge. Ballinger allegedly asked  to stretch her legs open as part of a joke, which the fan felt uncomfortable with. “At this point, I was like, uh oh, this is inappropriate, I’m not dressed for this,” the fan told HuffPost. “But I looked up to her so much and I just trusted her so much that I did it. I laid down and she just spread my legs wide open for everybody to see.” Ballinger did not respond to HuffPost's requests for comment. A Rolling Stone feature also  , featuring interviews from fans.

She continued, “Even though my team has strongly advised me not to say what I’m going to say, I realized they never said I couldn’t sing about what I want to say.” “A lot of people are saying some things about me that aren’t quite true. Doesn’t matter if it’s true, though, just as long as it’s entertaining to you, right?” Ballinger also sang in the video, which was shared to her Colleen Vlogs YouTube channel. “You guys having fun? All aboard the toxic gossip train, chugging down the tracks of misinformation. The toxic gossip train.” “I used to message my fans, but not in a creepy way, like a lot of you are trying to suggest,” she said in another part of the video. “It was more of a loser kind of way. I was just trying to be besties with everybody.” She also later sang the lyrics, “The only thing I’ve ever groomed is my two Persian cats / I’m not a groomer, just a loser / who didn’t understand I shouldn’t respond to fans / and I’m not a predator even a lot of you think so / because five years ago I made a fart joke.”  The video was met with widespread backlash, with some people accusing Ballinger of making light of a serious situation. In the wake of her viral ukulele apology video, several of Ballinger’s upcoming live shows on her national tour  . Ballinger’s podcast with fellow YouTuber Trisha Paytas, “Oversharing,” also ended after three episodes.

On Nov. 18, 2023, Ballinger   to her Colleen Vlogs channel in nearly five months.  In the video, called ""fall vlog,"" Ballinger said she now views her viral ukulele apology video as “really embarrassing, to say the least.” “I was being accused of some pretty awful things and I just was mad and I should have handled that situation with maturity and empathy, but instead I just let my ego take over and I’m really disappointed in myself,” she said. She also said that over the past 15 years of her career, there “have been moments where I was immature and inappropriate with some of my comedy.” “And there were times when I did not put enough thought into some of my fan interactions, and because of that behavior, people got hurt, and I am so sorry,” she added. “I never wanted to hurt anybody but it’s clear that I did, and I feel so terrible about that.” Ballinger said she had taken time away from YouTube to “make sure I was listening and learning as much as possible.” “I’m not a perfect person and there are plenty of things in my past I wish I could go back and redo and fix and change,” she continued. “I’m going to do everything that I can to make sure that I create a positive, kind and inclusive safe space online with my content, and if you want to be part of my journey online, I would love to have you, and if not, I completely understand.  “I do not expect anyone to welcome me back with open arms and I don’t expect to change anyone’s mind with this video,” she added. “I just wanted to come on here and say that I’m sorry.” Responses to her latest apology video were mixed online. McIntyre, the YouTuber who previously accused Ballinger of inappropriate behavior, shared his response to Ballinger’s latest video in  , entitled, “Colleen Ballinger Hasn’t Changed.” He called her November 2023 video a “slap in the face” and “performative,” and accused Ballinger of “diminishing everything as much as possible.” Others shared their support for Ballinger in the comments section of the video, with one fan writing that they were “so excited” to see her on YouTube again, and another saying they had “really missed” her videos.  Another person commented that they felt “really torn” by Ballinger’s recent video. “Used to be a huge fan, was pretty upset to see all the things that came out about you. I’m happy to know that you are doing well,” the person wrote. “I feel like apology was sincere but i want to see accountability, and whether it is public or private apologies to those involved. I hope this is a new start on a healthier path.” Lindsay Lowe has been a regular contributor to TODAY.com since 2016, covering pop culture, style, home and other lifestyle topics.

Superior Court Judge M.L. Villar made the ruling at at a preliminary hearing, after hearing roughly a day and a half of testimony. Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. The 35-year-old hip-hop star, fashion mogul and two-time Grammy nominee is in a  . Villar said “the totality of the video and testimony” shows there is sufficient evidence for the defendant to go to trial. She emphasized that preliminary hearings have a much lower evidence standard than a trial. Rocky, sitting in the courtroom, showed no visible reaction. “We’re not disappointed, not surprised, we expected to go to trial, we’ve been planning for trial all along,” Rocky’s attorney, Joe Tacopina, said outside court. “Rocky is going to be vindicated when all this is said and done, without question.” At the first day of the hearing, which resumed Monday after a long delay, Terell Ephron testified that he and Rocky, a friend since childhood, had belonged to the same collective of musicians and artists at their New York high school. He said their relationship had started to go sour and resulted in the standoff in Hollywood on Nov. 6, 2021, when he said Rocky first pulled a gun on him, and in a later confrontation fired shots that grazed Ephron’s knuckles. Tacopina established while questioning a police detective that seven officers who searched a sidewalk and street about 20 minutes after the shots were allegedly fired found no evidence of the shooting, and that a pair of 9 mm shell casings in police possession were recovered by Ephron, who returned to the scene about an hour after the standoff. Tacopina played body camera video of the officers, who searched the ground for about 10 minutes. Ephron, who first went to police to report the incident two days later, turned over the shell casings, which the detective said had no recoverable fingerprints on them. Prosecutors showed a separate video from near the scene where no people are initially visible, but what sounds like two gunshots can be heard. Then a man comes running around a corner, then slows to a walk. The man’s identity is not clear in the video, but LAPD Detective Frank Flores testified they have established it is Rocky. Flores testified under Tacopina’s questioning that no 9 mm pistol was recovered when a search warrant was served on Rocky. Prosecutors showed a still from surveillance video showing a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image from the same video showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. Flores testified that the combined images led them to establish it was Rocky. Tacopina, who is also representing Donald Trump in his New York criminal case and others, pressed the detective on the weapon, suggesting police had no way of knowing whether it was a loaded or even real gun. “That gun or whatever it was was not tested, right?” Tacopina asked. “No, it was never recovered,” Flores said. Tacopina asked, “You’re not sure if it’s an operable gun or a non-operable gun or whatever?” “Without having it, I can’t tell you whether it’s operable,” the detective replied. Tacopina also tried to cast doubt on the minor injury to Ephron’s hand, questioning why he waited until he returned to New York to seek medical treatment. He showed the detective a photo of the scraped fingers and said, sarcastically, “It’s a miracle he survived that shooting.” The judge admonished him, one of several times she told Tacopina to change his tone. Rocky was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in the case in April, and  . He arrived in the courtroom Monday morning wearing a dark suit, sunglasses and a face mask, after spending the weekend at the   Las Vegas Grand Prix auto race, where he had a   in the clothing brand’s partnership with F1. He has released little music in recent years, and has become better known as the romantic partner, fellow fashion influencer and  , with whom he had a second son in May. His first two studio albums in 2013 and 2015 both went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Rocky also became an unlikely cause for then-President Donald Trump, who said he was trying to get the rapper freed and returned to the U.S. when he was   in 2019. He was   but was given a “conditional sentence” that meant no additional jail time. In California courts, preliminary hearings like these are a sort of miniature version of a trial, with only a judge deciding whether sufficient evidence exists to move forward. The standard of proof for doing so is far lower than what’s required for criminal guilt. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

He served as president from 1977 until 1981. Here's a look at the family they created. Born in 1947, the Carters' oldest child, Jack Carter, followed his father into politics.

Chip Carter mourned the death of his mother following news of her passing. “Besides being a loving mother and extraordinary First Lady, my mother was a great humanitarian in her own right,” he   through the Carter Center. “Her life of service and compassion was an example for all Americans.

She ... tries to make sure that everyone has what they need, but gets embarrassed if she gets the credit she deserves. She is someone who is delighted when everyone is having a good time.

I like to think that I’m a little bit like her.” James Carter is the son of Chip Carter and Chip's ex-wife Caron Carter.

https://www.today.com/health/top-reasons-people-get-food-poisoning-thanksgiving-rcna55496,These are the top reasons people get sick on Thanksgiving,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands It's holiday season in the U.S., which means lots of time with family friends and food. And this combination also means lots of illness will go around, from RSV, flu and COVID-19 to foodborne diseases. Also known as food poisoning, foodborne illnesses occur when you eat something contaminated with disease-causing germs, including bacteria, parasites or viruses, and are left with an unpleasant bout of gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the . Every year in the U.S.,   (or 48 million) get sick, 128,000 become hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne diseases, per the CDC.  “We know that outbreaks of foodborne illness can and do happen around Thanksgiving,” Laura Ford, Ph.D., epidemiologist in the division of foodborne, waterborne and environmental diseases at the CDC, tells TODAY.com. “The CDC does not collect data specifically related to holidays, but some foods people enjoy during Thanksgiving can lead to serious foodborne illnesses, if the foods aren’t properly handled, cooked, stored or reheated.” Turkey, which is often the centerpiece of a Thanksgiving meal, can be contaminated with salmonella, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens and other germs, says Ford. Most of these can be killed by cooking foods to a safe internal temperature, Ford says, but raw poultry and its juices can also cross-contaminate anything they touch. Raw eggs used in stuffings, casseroles and desserts can also be contaminated with germs like escherichia coli, Ford adds.  During Thanksgiving, people are typically cooking much larger quantities of food than usual often under pressure, which allows for more mistakes, according to Robert Gravani, Ph.D., professor emeritus of food science at Cornell University.  “Those larger quantities of food require more attention to detail around the preparation, cooking, and cleanup,” Gravani tells TODAY.com. This applies to both beginners and experienced cooks because food safety mishaps are easier to make than you'd think.  “Contamination can happen at each step of food production chain, from farm to fork,” says Ford. These germs can even come from your own hands, such as  . Also known as the ""stomach flu,"" norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness outbreaks in the U.S.,  , and peaks during the winter months. “Once the contamination occurs, further mishandling, like undercooking the food or leaving it at unsafe temperatures, can make foodborne illness more likely,” Ford says. Salmonella is one of the most prevalent foodborne illnesses, and it’s  typically associated with raw poultry and eggs, says Gravani. Between 2017 and 2019, there was an outbreak of a type of multi-drug resistant salmonella that's common in live turkeys; it caused a reported 356 cases in 42 states, according to  . While not all raw poultry is infected with salmonella, it’s safest to assume it does and take precautions, Gravani says. According to the CDC,   bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the U.S., leading to nearly 1 million illnesses every year. Outbreaks occur most often in November and December. Clostridium perfringens can be found on raw meat and poultry, in the intestines of animals and humans, and in the environment, says Ford. The bacteria produces spores, which act like a protective coating that helps the bacteria survive high cooking temperatures,  . These can grow and multiply rapidly in cooked food left in the   (between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit) for longer than two hours, says Ford. Leaving large batches of food sitting out at room temperature is a fairly common practice on Thanksgiving, the experts note, because many people wait to store and refrigerate food until after everyone is finished with their meal or done circling back for seconds.  Common sources of clostridium perfringens infections include turkey, beef, gravies and soups, Ford says, but it can also come from other foods (including vegetarian dishes) cooked in large batches and held at unsafe temperatures. This is why outbreaks tend to occur in settings where food is served to big groups of people, such as catered events or cafeteria settings, Ford says. Past examples include   that sickened 40 at least people and   that involved hundreds of cases, both linked to catered Thanksgiving lunches at work, according to Ford. It can take anywhere from several hours to a few days after  , says Ford. For clostridium perfringens, symptoms typically begin within six to 24 hours after eating contaminated food, but for salmonella, symptoms can start anywhere from six hours to six days after, says Ford. “The most common symptoms of foodborne illness are an upset stomach, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever,” says Ford. Most people will have a mild illness lasting a few hours to several days, but some people can develop severe illness requiring hospitalization. Complications of foodborne illness include dehydration, hemolytic uremic syndrome (when the small blood vessels in the kidneys are damaged), and long-term health issues, like  , says Ford. In rare cases, severe food poisoning is deadly. Anyone can get a foodborne illness, but some groups of people are more likely to become infected and have severe illness, Ford says. These include children under the age of 5, adults over 65, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women. It’s important that cooks follow these four steps to minimize the risk of foodborne illness and ensure their Thanksgiving dinner is safe and healthy, Gravani says: Refrigerated leftovers will only last three or four days, says Ford. Freezing will help your leftovers keep longer, she notes, but always make sure to reheat food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent illness. Finally, if you are feeling sick, especially with any kind of gastrointestinal illness, avoid cooking if you can.

She had   and was going to re-introduce herself to her co-workers. For a moment, she paused to give herself a pep talk. “I’m saying to myself, ‘OK, you have to get out. You have to do this now. The Band Aid is ripped off, you have to do it,’” the CEO from Long Island recalled to TODAY.com. “I was tremendously anxious at that moment.” As soon as she stepped into the lobby, those fears began dissipating. “A few of my co-workers were coming out of the ladies room, and they came over and hugged me and were so sweet to me and caring that that anxiety melted away,” she said. Since she was about 7 years old, Nowland knew she was female but  didn’t transition for decades. That meant she had years to become comfortable with the idea of what she'd look like after gender affirming care. But she understood it could also mean other people in her life would take longer to adjust. “It didn’t take me a long time to get used to it because this is how it always felt,” Nowland said. “But to your friends and co-workers and the owner of the butcher that you go to once a week or the waiter at your favorite restaurant, they’ve known you as a certain gender for years and years. … You’re all of a sudden looking very different.”   However, Nowland felt struck by how supportive everyone in her workplace was, from co-workers to vendors to clients.

Some of the people she thought might have been the least supportive because of their politics became some of her biggest boosters. “Most times, people have these opinions on a relatively uninformed basis, specifically dealing with trans people. They’ve never met a trans person before,” Nowland said. “(My colleagues) knew the person I was before, and in many cases I had helped them in their careers and their success. So even if they might not have understood what I was doing, they gave me the benefit of the doubt.” Nowland thinks that knowing her has helped them continue to confront some of their biases. “I have taught them, and as time goes on, some of them understand it more and really have become true allies,” she said. Nowland wanted to share her experience with transitioning because it felt so supportive and affirming — something she knows that many trans people do not encounter. “My story was really basically a positive one, and there’s no horror story,” Nowland said. “I certainly had all of those anxieties and fears, but again — this is just for me — they really turned out to be unfounded.” Since then, Nowland has been moved by gender euphoria, little moments often taken for granted by people who aren't trans. “I have a whole group of new friends that are cis women. Most of them for whatever reason happened to be younger than I am,” she explained. “These are just relationships that I treasure and value so much — never in a million years would I have thought that would happen. And my transition and my gender status is not even a blip for them. I’m just one of the girls.” But Nowland also knows that her experience might be vastly different than others'. “I had a very positive experience. Now, I also recognize that I come from a position of privilege,” she said. “I was able to use those things to probably make my transition a little easier for instance than some 20-year-old person of color who is coming out. It’s definitely a different experience for them than I had.” Still, she wanted to share her experience to show the benefits of transitioning. “People tend to be accepting of things and start to understand things when they become normalized,” she said. “If people get exposed to me and my experiences in the business world versus things that are out there in the media and in other sources, then I think it just helps normalize the process, and that can be beneficial.”  After five years, Nowland doesn’t often need to explain herself because so many people have embraced her, though she has encountered some clients who don't want to work with her because she’s trans. It’s a small group, and she's not too bothered by it, hoping that when people hear about her experience, they'll learn something. “A trans person is just a person like everybody else. We want to get up in the morning, do our thing, have our friends, do our jobs and enjoy our life — just like everyone else wants,” Nowland said. “One’s gender identity really has nothing to do with who a person is. If you liked the person before, you’re going to like them afterward.” Meghan Holohan is a digital health reporter for TODAY.com who covers patient-centered stories, women's health, disability, rare diseases among other topics. She enjoys cooking, yoga, reading, music and walking her two rescue dogs.

https://www.today.com/parents/moms/mom-defends-dad-didnt-sit-kids-plane-rcna126005,Mom defends dad who sat apart from their family on a plane,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands A New Jersey mom is defending her husband, who enjoyed in-flight entertainment while she entertained their two kids.  In a now-viral Instagram video, Maria Roberts, 37, is shown sandwiched between her 5-year-old son, Luca, and 3-year-old daughter, Kaia. Maria’s husband Lou, is seated directly across from his family. While Maria fetches snacks, untangles cords, and pulls toys from the carry-on bags that she packed, Lou takes the opportunity to zone out with headphones. “As Lou likes to say, ‘I would switch with you, but they refuse to sit next to me,’” Maria captioned her clip, which has been seen nearly 15 million times. “I never expected the comments to be so angry,” Maria, a speech pathologist, tells  .com.  “I hate that this is still a standard we are promoting. Even young children can learn that that Dad is a good option and don’t need to always be with mom. Please for the love of God stop reinforcing that dads are incapable,” one person wrote. Added another, “You deserve better!! We each take one kid and they go in the window seat, younger one in the row behind so their feet only kick their brother. Husband manages one kid’s entertainment and snacks, and I do the same.” That wouldn't work for the Roberts family. ""The kid that isn't with me would be crawling over the rows to get to me and that would cause a scene,"" Maria says. ""We're just doing what makes our lives easier and this is what works for us."" She notes that if she and Lou switched seats, Luca and Kaia would simply relocate to her lap. “I like making moms laugh and letting them know, ‘You’re not alone in this,’” she explains. “As far as the negativity goes, I’m not offended and neither is Lou. Just because he sits in the fourth seat on an airplane doesn’t mean he’s not an amazing dad.”  As for the headphones that some commenters called ""triggering,"" Maria says they were turned down. She doesn't understand what the big deal is.  “The second I flag him, he takes them off,"" she says. “I don’t expect him to stare at us the entire flight.""  Maria says that she and Lou “divide and conquer” in different ways. For instance, he makes all restaurant reservations on vacation, and pulls the car around when it’s raining. He also pushes the double stroller and does all the ""heavy lifting."" “Everyone has their opinion and they’re entitled to their opinion.. But I know I have a great husband,” she says. “We have equal parts, they’re just different.”  Rachel Paula Abrahamson is a lifestyle reporter who writes for the parenting, health and shop verticals.

The ""Life Of Da Party"" rapper, who's been an enthusiastic marijuana user for years, announced the news Nov. 16 on social media.  ""After much consideration & conversation with my family, I’ve decided to give up smoke. Please respect my privacy at this time,” he wrote in a message posted on his official   and   accounts. Some fans of the 52-year-old hip-hop star, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, had a hard time believing he could be serious about ditching weed, and they said so in the comments of his post. ""Ay noway this cannot be real,"" wrote one. ""I’m unsure if I should report this post as hacked,"" another joked. A few wondered if Snoop specified that he was quitting “smoke” because he intended to switch to another form of marijuana.  “Snoop is launching edibles company,” one predicted. Others cheered for the rapper's decision, pointing out that it might be a positive step for his health. ""Love and respect G always do what’s best for you! Love that you’re doing what feels right for you!"" said one well-wisher. Over the years, Snoop Dogg has been candid about his love of pot both in his music and an in interviews.  The rapper made his debut on Dr. Dre's 1992 album ""The Chronic,"" which featured the image of a marijuana plant in its album art, and later appeared alongside Dave Chappelle in the 1998 stoner cult comedy ""Half-Baked."" He's also regaled late-night audiences with candid stories about getting high with other weed-loving celebrities,  , 54, and  , 90.  Snoop Dogg is the father to four children: Codre, 29, Cordell, 26, Cori, 24 and Julian, 25.

https://www.today.com/shop/candle-warmer-lamp-review-rcna124058,My favorite candle has lasted a whole year — thanks to this gadget,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands My evening routine goes something like this: get home, change into my   and immediately light a candle. One could say that I have a healthy obsession with candles — and it can get expensive! That's when I turned to Amazon to try and find a solution — it came in the form of a candle warmer. I discovered this model on Amazon around this time last year and immediately fell in love with how chic it was. It was a no-brainer purchase for me.  Before finding this gadget, I was spending so much money on replacing my candles. Since buying this warmer, I haven't needed to replace the candle in over a year — and it's still going strong! After some time, I remember thinking the scent of the candle would deteriorate the longer I used it. Boy, was I wrong!  The candle still smells great and leaves my space with a nice aroma. Plus, I get to continue to enjoy one of my favorite scents without worrying about having to find a new one soon.  To use it, all you have to do is place your favorite candle on the wooden base under the light, plug it in and use the dimmer switch to choose your desired strength — it's really that easy!  We've all had that sinking feeling as soon as we leave the house. Did I turn off the stove, unplug my hair curler, blow out the candle? While I've yet to find a solution to that horrible nagging feeling, at least my mind can rest easy about candles after I leave the house. I still make sure to turn it off at the end of each night, but I no longer have that overwhelming anxiety that I could burn down my apartment building.  This candle warmer would also be great if you have kids or pets since there is no open flame. I'd still suggest monitoring young children and our furry friends around it due to the hot wax, but overall it's better than the alternative. One thing to note, though, is that the cord isn't super long. So, you'll need to keep that in mind when determining where you'll place it in your home.  If the style and functionality of this candle warmer wasn't enough to sell me on it, the compliments that pour in from my guests would be! I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the first things people remark on when they come over. I love that it's a trendy item (just look to your favorite influencers for proof) but also that it's something I think I'll have for a long time. Plus, it makes for the perfect gift!

https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/winter-skin-care-tips-rcna67038,Dermatologists reveal 12 ways to prevent and soothe dry winter skin,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands As the cold winter weather rolls in, you might also notice your skin feeling dry and irritated. That's why, experts say, it's time to switch up your skin-care routine to keep your skin feeling moisturized and healthy. Swapping in   and scaling back on others can be a game-changer to soothe angry winter skin. Winter typically brings air that's cold and dry, which can affect your skin, Dr. Shasa Hu, associate professor in the department of dermatology and cutaneous surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. ""Those who also have a heater in their office or apartment, that further dries out the air,"" she says. Thanks to these environmental factors, it’s common for skin to feel dry more frequently in the winter. The cold, dry winter season can also exacerbate some skin common conditions, including   and  . Another condition,  , can also flare in the winter, which can also be due to a lack of ambient sun exposure, Hu explains. Whether you have one of those skin conditions or not, pretty much everyone can benefit from making some simple tweaks to their skin care routine as the weather and our habits change. You should definitely   at least once a day, Dr. Shari Lipner, associate professor of clinical dermatology at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, tells TODAY.com. But if you find that your skin feels tight or dry after washing it in the winter, you don't need to wash it any more than that, she says. ""Cleansing your skin is OK, but   multiple times a day."" Instead, she recommends cleansing your face fully in the evening and just using a splash of water in the morning. You can also try using more  , like cream cleansers, rather than foaming face washes, Hu says. ""Lotion cleansers are typically less stripping of the natural (oil) on the skin,"" she adds. Winter is not the time to slack on using your moisturizer.  ""If you're not regular about moisturizing your skin, it may not matter much in the spring or summer,"" Lipner says. ""But in the winter, your skin is going to feel it.""  You may even want to level up your moisturizer to something thicker during the winter months to help prevent dryness, Hu says. She also recommends playing around with thicker formulations of the other products in your rotation, like swapping your   for a  . And if you find that you're still getting dry spots on your skin, Lipner suggests carrying a travel-sized container of ointment (such as Vaseline or Aquaphor) around with you to apply throughout the day. The   recommends that people with dry skin looking for moisturizers that contain these ingredients:  With shorter days, people may get a little ""lazy"" with their sunscreen application, Lipner says. But   — at least 30 SPF — every day as part of your usual skin care routine. We get fewer UV rays in the winter, Lipner says, ""but we do get them."" And if you'll be outside at high altitudes or skiing, it's especially important to stay protected and remember to reapply every two hours. Lipner recommends people don't do too much exfoliating year-round — and especially during the winter. If you're someone who gets a lot of buildup on your face, you may want to   or even just once a month, she says.  ""For winter I would recommend doing it even less,"" Lipner says, because these products are more likely to be irritating on dry or sensitive skin.  And when it comes to using  , ""if you're used to using them, see how your skin feels,"" Lipner says.  Some people may be able to keep using them just as frequently despite the change in weather. But others may find that their skin gets too sensitive in the winter and that they need to use retinoids less often or to cut them out temporarily. Another retinoid tip from Lipner for those with irritable skin: ""You can dilute (your  ) with a drop of moisturizer and that makes a big difference,"" she says. The AAD specifically recommends that people with dry skin take caution with (or completely avoid) skin-care products with these ingredients: Because a heater can dry out already dry winter air, Hu suggests using a humidifier in your bedroom or at your desk to keep your skin a little happier. ""A   can make a big difference in your skin if the air is very dry,"" Lipner agrees.  Long, hot   can actually dry your skin out, the experts say. So try to keep the water lukewarm and your time in the water short. And, when you get out of the shower, put your moisturizer and body lotion on while your skin is still damp (but not dripping wet), Lipner says. That will help seal that hydration into your skin.  ""It's something we recommend to people with dry skin all year long, but in the winter, it's even more important,"" Hu agrees. Try to limit your shower or bath time to just 5 to 10 minutes, the AAD recommends. People with sensitive skin likely already know to be on the lookout for common irritants — including fragrance — in any product that may touch their skin. And that becomes even more important during the winter, Hu says.  If you're prone to skin reactions and not already using fragrance-free laundry detergent, dryer sheets and body care products, now is the time to switch, she says. People typically don't notice that their nails are in need of care until the weather gets warm enough for sandals, but many of those issues (including fungal infections) may start building up in the winter, Lipner explains. If you notice your nails getting  , those are signs that you should check in with a dermatologist now rather than waiting until the spring or summer. If you have dry skin during the wintertime, dressing warmly — in particular,   — can help protect your skin and keep you comfortable. People with dry skin should wear gloves whenever they go outside in cold winter weather, the AAD recommends. They should also wear gloves whenever they perform tasks that require them to get their hands wet, such as washing the dishes, or when their hands may come into contact with cleaning products or other harsh chemicals. It’s the season to gather around the fireplace or stay bundled up near the heater, but the AAD cautions that spending time near heat sources like these can further dry out your skin. Along with your nails, your lips also may need some extra attention during the winter. That’s why the AAD recommends using   that doesn’t tingle or sting your dry lips. A tingly reaction like that might feel nice temporarily, but it could also mean that your lip balm contains an ingredient like camphor or menthol. Unfortunately, these ingredients can exacerbate dehydration and cause sensitivity down the line. Look for ingredients that hydrate, moisture and protect your lips, experts  , such as glycerin, shea butter, beeswax, olive oil, castor oil and coconut oil. People with really severely dry and cracked skin may have a broken skin barrier, which can take weeks or months to properly heal, Hu explains.  ""It takes at least three to four weeks for that skin barrier to fully repair, so start early,"" she says. And if you're not seeing results after a few days, don't give up. Finally, if you're someone with a skin condition like eczema, psoriasis or rosacea, or you're just not getting what you want out of your skin care, don't hesitate to contact your dermatologist. ""If you have any of these conditions, it's a great time to check in to make sure the winter is not causing havoc on your skin,"" Lipner says, adding that telemedicine is a great option for this. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

https://www.today.com/popculture/music/taylor-swift-rio-concert-chaos-fans-describe-unbearable-friday-show-rcna126031,Taylor Swift Rio concert chaos: Fans describe ‘unbearable’ Friday show,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands When Taylor Swift finally took the Eras Tour to Rio de Janeiro on Friday, fans — and even the iconic   — welcomed her with open arms. What was supposed to be a “dream” for thousands of Swifties  , with the death of a fan in sweltering conditions. NBC News spoke with four fans who were standing in various sections of the stadium during Friday’s show at Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium. They said they saw multiple people pass out. Water was also scarce because attendees were not allowed to bring it in. Igor Paiva, 33, who traveled from the capital, Brasília, to attend Swift’s show, described “abysmal” heat, fans’ passing out by the dozens and a stadium that was “unequipped” to handle it. “I regretted going as soon as I got there. … I was just drenched in sweat,” he said. “There was nowhere to go. We weren’t allowed to have water. There were no water fountains.” Still, many fans were not as lucky as Paiva, who had tickets to all three Rio shows. Sunday’s show, he said, was as “smooth as it could be.” Swift performed in reportedly better —   — conditions. For those who could only secure tickets for Friday, there was no concert do-over, and memories of their Swift show were clouded by the poor concertgoing experience.   Parts of Brazil have been experiencing a heat wave since Nov. 12. Temperatures in Rio reached 88 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity at 66% around 6 p.m., according to  , and Saturday was even warmer. The city on Friday reported its highest heat index recorded since measurements began in 2014 — 138 degrees Fahrenheit — which broke the previous record set Tuesday, according to MetSul Meteorologia. Paiva made the difficult decision to leave the Friday concert halfway through Swift’s 3 ½-hour set. “I was feeling weak, nauseated. I had blurred vision. It was not a good place to be. So I made a decision to leave because I just could not bear it until the end,” he said. “I just could not find somewhere to catch a breath of fresh air.”  When he finally decided to leave, he couldn’t find an exit.  “That’s when I began to realize how bad the situation was,” Paiva said. “When I left, it was not easy for me to find an exit, because everything was covered up; the gaps in the stadium were covered.”  Paiva said that the stadium typically has more airflow, but that “wooden planks” appeared to have been drilled over the gaps in the stadium, turning an already stifling environment into an “inferno.” He got a text from his friends in the general admission pit that said: “People are passing out. We need help. We need water.” “There was just no way for water to get to people, even for them to buy water. They couldn’t leave their places. It was impossible,” Paiva said. Time4Ffun, or T4F, the company that organized the Eras Tour in Brazil, and a representative for Swift didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a  , T4F said that it would allow fans to take certain water bottles and food into the venue and that free water would be available in the lines and in multiple places in the stadium. It also said more medical stations, ambulances and mobile ICUs would be made available.  Rio’s city hall reiterated the change in restrictions for food and beverages   Saturday. The office said in an email statement on Monday that the stadium is property of the city, but was leased to Botafogo, a Brazilian football club, which has been responsible for its operations since 2007. NBC News has reached out to the team for comment. Liana Hiltner, 24, a Brazilian fan from Salvador, said she experienced heatstroke at Friday’s concert and struggled to get medical attention. “I knew it would be hot and did everything I could to not get sick, but I got heatstroke and had to look for medical attention,” she said. “My body failed me, but my dream kept me going.” Hiltner said no medic was stationed in her section. “I started to puke. I was shaking, trembling, and yeah, it was bad. I was sweating. I was pouring water over myself to cool down, and the vents were indeed covered,” Hiltner said, referring to the wooden boards that appeared to restrict airflow into the stadium. The girl behind Hiltner was proposed to during the song “Love Story” and appeared to nearly pass out afterward. After the proposal, she told Hiltner: “I’m not feeling good. I’m not feeling good.” Looking for water and medical attention while she was feeling sick was “hell,” Hiltner said. She was also afraid to lose her spot or be given medication that would force her to miss the rest of the show. “It was my dream,” she said. “I would not lose my dream. I also had my cousin with me. It was also her dream.” Andrea Rosas’ water bottle was confiscated at the entrance, and she struggled to access water in the stadium. “As soon as I got into the stadium, I tried to buy water. There were some people going around trying to sell water, and I bought from them,” said Rosas, 29. “I paid, but they never came back with the water that I paid for.” She was faced with a difficult decision: remain where she was and risk severe dehydration in the heat or go inside to buy water from the stadium itself and lose the spot she had spent hours waiting in line in the sun to secure. “I decided to go inside and lose my spot to get water,” Rosas said, adding the water was about $2 and it was “not even a bottle that they were selling. It was just a cup of water.” T4F said in its notice Saturday that it was not responsible for providing water and food at the venue. Rosas traveled from her home in Lima, Peru, to attend all three nights of Swift’s scheduled shows in Rio de Janeiro. She said she “almost fainted, like, four times” during the show and got “really scared” when she saw a fan vomiting. Rosas saw security dragging people over the barricade after they passed out. Many described people fainting during Swift’s set and being unable to get help. “Other big shows, like Harry Styles and Coldplay, had general admission when they came here,” Rosas said. “It was not that. It was the heat, and the stadium was not ready.” On the way home, she found out from social media that a  . “I cried when I found out. I felt like it could have been me, and I just thought about my mom,” she said. “I was like, this could be any of us in the stadium. So I’m trying to just thank God that I got home safe. But I was very, very sad.” Swift wrote in an Instagram story early Saturday about the death of a fan before her show and said she felt “overwhelmed by grief.” The fan, identified as Ana Clara Benevides Machado, felt unwell and was taken to the medical center and later to a hospital, where she died, organizer T4F said Saturday. The cause of death hasn’t been released. Joey Yagoda, 31, a New Yorker living in Argentina, described the water bottles the stadium was selling as “the size of a Jello cup.” He recalled some water availability during the set of Sabrina Carpenter, Swift’s opening act. As the night progressed, Yagoda said, water access in his section tapered off and eventually stopped completely. Swift herself started   into the crowd while she sang. During the third “era” of the show, Swift   for several minutes as a group of fans screamed for water. “Can I get a signal that you know where they are?” Swift said in a   posted to TikTok during Friday’s concert.   Yagoda said it seemed as though Swift had realized at that point that the venue might not be equipped to reach people when they needed help.  “Eventually, they started throwing water into the crowd,” Yagoda said. “Not just Taylor; like, somebody started throwing water in the crowd, and I’m not sure if it was Taylor’s people or the stadium people, but it wasn’t enough.” The scariest thing, he said, was watching a girl faint in front of him.  “She collapsed, and she was with a bunch of friends,” Yagoda said. “Then they picked her up — like, somebody tried to get help. … There was no way to alert somebody the way in the U.S. you can alert an usher.” The girl’s friends tried to get the attention of security, and when they couldn’t, they eventually carried her out of the crowd themselves, he said. He saw multiple people pass out around him at the show.  He thought at first that it was just his section of the crowd that was struggling. Before he knew the full scope of the issues in the stadium, he said, he was concerned about whether “there were enough people on the stadium site to identify where people were or to know what to actually do.” Yagoda, who is familiar with the general admission format for most concerts in Latin America, attributed the “public health issue” at the concert to a confluence of factors: the extremity of the heat and the humidity, the lack of support from stadium staff members and the long lines in the sun required to secure prime views of Swift. “There are just, like, so many really, really long lines for the stadium, and it’s going, like, many blocks around, so basically, we got there at maybe, like, 4:30 or 5 p.m., and you’re waiting in line for an hour to get in in the sweltering heat,” Yagoda said. “So that means that for some people, they were waiting in line since 7 a.m. on Thursday. You’re waiting in line for, like, 36 hours before you even get in.”  Paiva said the VIP gates were supposed to open at 3 p.m. local time but opened over an hour late, forcing fans to extend their time standing in the sun before the show. “Some people passed out because they were standing in line during the day, all day long, in the heat, with no shade, no restroom, no support,” he said. “If they left the line, they would lose their position, you know, so it was just insane.” As news of conditions in the stadium and the death of a fan spread, some   and   demanded accountability from T4F. The heat during Saturday’s show was forecast to be even worse. New rules were announced that morning: Fans would be   to take food and   into the stadium. The barricades were lined with cases of water bottles, and the air vents appeared to be unobstructed, Rosas said. The show was postponed an hour before it was scheduled to begin, after thousands of fans had spent all day in line and were already in the stadium. “The safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performers, and crew has to and always will come first,”   about the postponement. The show was rescheduled for Monday. “It’s really sad to think that Brazilians wouldn’t get a chance to experience Taylor like they deserve,” said Paiva, one of the attendees. “I don’t think Brazilians are to blame. I don’t think the fans are to blame. I honestly think it’s this corporation,” T4F. Paiva said that he had been concerned about attending a show of such magnitude in Rio de Janeiro, which he acknowledged has problems with infrastructure and public safety, but that the conditions were far worse than he expected and mostly preventable. “I don’t think that it’s impossible to go to a concert when we have heat like that, but I believe there was such bad decision-making for the first night,” he said. “Everything that could go wrong did.” Swift is expected to perform Saturday’s rescheduled show in Rio Monday night.

""I will be in the stands,"" she   ahead of the game. ""I'm a stands girl — I love sitting in the stands, cheering with the fans, even if it's in an opposing team's stadium."" And she's ready for a win. ""I hope we will get my husband's first win against the Kansas City Chiefs in his career. He is 13 years in. We're due, I think. Sorry guys,"" she said. The last time the Eagles faced the Chiefs was back in February at Super Bowl LVII, where the Chiefs edged out a win 38-35. A regular season game featuring the previous year's Super Bowl opponents is rare, as the Chiefs-Eagles matchup is just the ninth time in NFL history that it's happened,  . In addition to the Super Bowl rematch, all eyes are on a certain Chiefs tight end, as   heats up. The 31-year-old attributed the ""tight squeeze"" in her brother-in-law's suite as one more reason she wants to stick it out in the stands. ""Travis has a lot of people who come to games — appropriately so, everyone loves to support him. But it means that it's a tight squeeze in there,"" she said. ""Also, it's fun to cheer and not feel like the entire room's rooting against you."" She also addressed the news that her husband was named  . “I mean, I knew this. I’ve known this the whole time — this is not news to me,” she joked. “It’s funny to see those things sort of rolling in because at the end of the day, he’s still tucking in toddlers at the end of the night and getting called in for kid duty.” Kylie and Jason Kelce, 36, wed in 2018, and  . While Kylie Kelce and her  , will be at Monday night's game, Swift won't be able to attend. The singer has to perform a rescheduled show on her ""Eras Tour"" in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The concert, originally scheduled for Nov. 18, was cancelled at the last minute due to extreme heat in the Brazilian city. “The safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performers and crew has to and will always come first,” Swift wrote in a post on her Instagram story on Nov. 18 announcing the cancellation.  The cancellation came one day after   before her Nov. 17 ""Eras Tour"" performance. Time4Fun, the organizer of the shows in Brazil, later identified the fan as 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides Machado. Time4Fun did not specify Machado's cause of death, but said a team of firefighters and paramedics attended to her at the stadium before she was transported to an area hospital, where she later died. Swift said in a statement it was ""the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil."" ""I can’t believe I’m writing these words but it is with a shattered heart that I say we lost a fan earlier tonight before my show,” she said. “I can’t even tell you how devastated I am by this. There’s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young,"" Swift said in an Instagram story on Nov. 17.

https://www.today.com/news/president-pardon-turkeys-thanksgiving-rcna125973,Why does the president pardon turkeys at the White House every Thanksgiving?,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands With Thanksgiving just a few days away, the White House is marking one of its quirkiest holiday traditions: the presidential turkey pardon. Each year, the president pardons one or two lucky gobblers for unspecified offenses, sparing them from the Thanksgiving dinner table. This year, President Biden will pardon Liberty and Bell, two 42-pound turkeys hailing from Willmar, Minnesota, on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 20. In keeping with tradition, Liberty and Bell spent the evening before their pardon in a luxury suite at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, D.C. There’s no doubt the turkey pardon has become a beloved White House tradition, but why do U.S. presidents pardon turkeys to begin with? The National Turkey Federation and the Poultry and Egg National Board began sending U.S. presidents turkeys in 1947, according to the  . In the early days, these birds were still definitely on the menu. For example, when President Truman received two turkeys in December 1948, he noted that the birds would “come in handy” for Christmas dinner, according to the WHHA. That said, over the following decades, some presidents informally spared the lives of their gifted turkeys from time to time.  In 1963, President Kennedy saved a turkey that had been sent to him by the poultry industry, saying he would just “let this one grow,” according to the  . In 1973, first lady Patricia Nixon also spared the life of a turkey sent to the White House, sending it to live on a children’s farm.  In 1978,   followed suit, sending that year’s turkey to live out its days at a mini zoo, according to the WHHA.  During Ronald Reagan’s presidency, the turkey pardon became more of a regular practice. However, it wasn’t until 1989, under President George H. W. Bush, that the turkey pardon became an annual tradition. Bush had been sent a turkey that year, and as animal rights activists picketed nearby, he promised that the bird would not meet an untimely end. “Let me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone’s dinner table, not this guy — he’s presented a presidential pardon as of right now — and allow him to live out his days on a children’s farm not far from here,” Bush said, according to the WHHA. Since then, the turkey pardon became a regular White House tradition. The WHHA also notes that while a tale has circulated about President Lincoln sparing the first Thanksgiving turkey back in 1863, this is likely a myth. These days, pardoned Thanksgiving turkeys live out their days in comfort. After their whirlwind visit to Washington, D.C., this year’s turkeys, Liberty and Bell, will return to their home state of Minnesota and will be cared for by the University of Minnesota’s College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences.  “You can imagine the wonderful care they’re going to get from students and veterinarians and professors,"" Steve Lykken, chairman of the National Turkey Federation, told the  .

https://www.today.com/popculture/news/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-cassie-rcna125609,Cassie accuses Sean 'Diddy' Combs of rape and years of abuse in new lawsuit,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs faced a lawsuit filed by singer Cassie Ventura that accused Combs of using his position of power as a music executive and wealth to abuse Ventura for nearly 10 years. A day after it was filed,   on Nov. 17.  “I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control,” Ventura said in a statement. “I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.” Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The attorney for Combs said in a statement on Nov. 18 that the decision to settle ""is in no way an admission of wrongdoing.” “I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love,” Combs said in a statement. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said Combs pursued her as a 19-year-old who was signed to his label. What followed, she says, was a decade of abuse amid an ""ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle."" ""After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,"" Ventura said in a statement to NBC News after filing the lawsuit.  The following are accusations Ventura made against Combs in the 35-page complaint, all of which Combs denied.  Ventura alleged that Combs was ""prone to uncontrollable rage"" during their relationship and ""frequently beat Ms. Ventura savagely,"" the lawsuit said.  The physical abuse continued over the course of a decade and occurred multiple times a year. Combs would leave bruises on Ventura and then hide her in hotels for days to let them heal in order to conceal the effects of the abuse, the lawsuit said.  She cited one instance in which he allegedly kicked and hit her in a Cadillac Escalade after a party with rapper Jay-Z. Ventura also alleged that in a 2009 incident, Combs pushed her into a corner of a vehicle and started ""stomping on her face"" after learning she had spoken to another music manager at a party in Los Angeles. She was ""bleeding profusely"" and began throwing up from the assault, the lawsuit said.  Combs demanded that Ventura hold his gun in her purse on two occasions, the lawsuit said  “Ms. Ventura had no familiarity with guns and was petrified that the firearm would accidentally go off in her purse,” her lawyers said in the suit.  The rap mogul also introduced Ventura to a “drug-fueled lifestyle,” including introducing her to opiates in 2008. He demanded she procure prescription painkillers in her own name to satisfy his addiction, the lawsuit said.   Ventura alleged in the lawsuit that, within a few months of the beginning of their relationship, Combs directed her to perform sex acts with a man hired by Combs while he watched and masturbated.  Combs called the arrangement a “Freak Off,” or “FO."" He would tell Ventura he wanted an ""FO,"" and expected her to arrange the location and the hiring of male sex workers, the suit said.   At one point he wanted them weekly and had them set up at various luxury hotels in multiple cities, court documents say. Ventura alleged that she was given ecstasy, cocaine, GHB, ketamine, marijuana, and alcohol in excessive amounts during these encounters, which Combs often filmed, the documents said.  During one at a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016, Combs punched Ventura in the face and gave her a black eye, the filing says. When she tried to leave the room when he was asleep, Combs ""took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator to escape,"" the filing stated.  Ventura alleged that Combs later paid the hotel $50,000 for the hallway security footage from that evening.  Ventura had a brief relationship with rapper Kid Cudi in 2011 during a ""rough patch"" in her relationship with Combs, the lawsuit said. Combs found emails on Ventura's phone between her and Kid Cudi, became enraged, and then placed a corkscrew between his fingers and lunged at her, the filing said.  Combs then told Ventura during Paris Fashion Week in 2012 that he was going to blow up Cudi's car, and around that time, Cudi's car exploded in his driveway, the filing ssaid.  Cudi did not respond to TODAY.com’s request for comment. Ventura alleged in the lawsuit that after a dinner in September 2018 in which she tried to end their relationship, Combs forced himself into her apartment and raped her while she tried to push him away.  The singer said she ""continues to suffer from immense emotional distress"" and that she has struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol due to her relationship with Combs, according to the suit.  Combs — who has been active in the music scene for decades and previously gone by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy — has denied any wrongdoing. Before the settlement, Combs' attorney, Ben Brafman, gave NBC News the following statement: “Mr. Combs vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations. For the past 6 months, Mr. Combs, has been subjected to Ms. Ventura’s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail. Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’ reputation and seeking a pay day.” Before the settlement, Ventura's lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, sent the following response to Brafman's comments:  Mr. Comb’s offered Ms. Ventura eight figures to silence her and prevent the filing of this lawsuit. She rejected his efforts and decided to give a voice to all woman who suffer in silence. Ms. Ventura should be applauded for her bravery.” Ventura says that she ""required intensive medical and psychological care"" following the trauma of her relationship with Combs, though she has since married and welcomed two children.  ""She cannot, however, continue to live in silence about what she endured. Mr. Combs remains immensely powerful, and immensely dangerous,"" the suit alleges. ""Ms. Ventura therefore seeks justice for the decade of her life that Mr. Combs took away from her with threats of violence, excessive use of drugs, physical and psychological abuse, and sexual slavery."" She was seeking unspecified damages in the lawsuit. Ventura’s lawsuit says she was “unable to speak up against the years of abuse she endured,” but that she is now able to address the trauma. The lawsuit was brought through the  . The New York law allows people who say they were victims of sexual abuse to file civil suits after the statute of limitations has expired. The one-year window that allowed people to file cases under the law expired a week after she filed the lawsuit.  In her statement, she cited the law: ""With the expiration of New York’s Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.""

The first time I used the UTO Belt Bag, I couldn't believe how many items I could squeeze into it. I wore it during a recent afternoon outing with a friend and was able to fit a pair of sunglasses, two iPhones, a set of keys, a Kindle, an AirPods case, lip balm, two credit cards and an ID — basically, everything I needed for the day. I think if I was strategic about it and needed to add a few more small items, like a phone charger or an energy bar, I could have made it work. (A few days later, I even managed to fit a full tube of my   and a   in there along with most of my essentials.) I do have another belt bag, but for me, this one stands out from the rest, thanks to its many pockets. When you open the bag, the interior reveals three compartments: Two large main ones and a smaller zippered one in the middle. The roomier sections are perfect for larger items, like your phone or a wallet, while the zippered space is great for smaller things that you'd want to keep safe, like cash or cards. In addition to those pockets, there's also a big zippered one in the front (it's discreetly hidden, so you don't see a bulky zipper popping out) and a small one in the back. All that's to say, it's definitely not lacking in safe spots for your daily essentials. If you're anything like me, you'll appreciate how easily the black option can be paired with any outfit, from casual leggings and a tee to a dressy blazer and jeans. But, if you're looking for something more bold, you'll be happy to hear that this bag comes in more than 70 (yes, you read that correctly) styles and colors. There are   that come in a range of shades and patterns, from leopard print to light blue, options that are made out of faux leather and even some that come with an additional pouch attached for even more storage space. The specific make that I got, 1023 Black, is available in just two other colors — Quilted Black and Gray. And really, the only complaint that I have about this bag so far was how hard it was to choose one when ordering. Though, it seems like you really can't go wrong. And since most options are around $20, I wouldn't blame you if you got a few! The bag can also be worn multiple ways, as it has an adjustable strap that the brand says can be expanded from 23- to 53-inches (though sizing can change depending on the style you choose). While I've only worn mine as a crossbody bag and don't see myself using it as a fanny pack any time soon, it's nice to know that I have the option. I can also see myself just throwing it over my shoulder if I wear something bulkier, where the crossbody fit might feel awkward or snug. Now that I have my go-to canvas totes, a professional-looking bag and this belt bag for days spent running errands, getting brunch with friends and basically every activity in-between, my bag collection feels complete. And if you ask me which one I'd grab first as I'm headed out the door, this one would win almost every time. Emma Stessman is an Associate Editor for Shop TODAY. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/olive-garden-cheese-grater-rcna121045,Olive Garden is now selling its viral cheese graters online,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Just imagine: You’re sitting at your table at Olive Garden, and the server brings over your heaping bowl of pasta and starts grating cheese over it. “Just tell me when,” they say as as a snowstorm of cheese cascades onto your dish. “Never,” you say. “In fact, I would like to take that cheese grater home with me.” “Sure,” the server says. “You can buy this right off me after I’m done grating.” Does that seem like a far-off dream? Well, it’s closer to reality than you think, because Olive Garden has been known to sell its cheese graters in restaurant — and now they’re being sold online, too. Olive Garden’s cheese graters are   for $15 a piece with a limit of 10 per order. They’re also final sale. “You never need to ‘say when’ when you’re grating cheese from the comfort of your own home,” reads the product description. And the merch doesn’t stop there. Guests can shop for the chain’s “Seasons Gratings” holiday sweater, soup, salad and breadstick-themed apparel and shoe charms, breadstick plush for pets and more on Olive Garden’s  .

She then shows off a container filled with cubes of cheese, care of the company. To test out the validity of this claim, popular TikToker Jordan the Stallion tried out getting one for himself   with more than 15 million views posted several days later. “I heard this information. I woke up at six in the morning. I haven’t even seen my family yet. I need to see if this is true,” says Jordan in the video, adding that he was waiting for his local Olive Garden to open.  “I was 95.7% sure that that was not going to work,” Jordan said as the video cuts to him holding an Olive Garden bag. The TikToker says he went to the manager and the process was as easy as getting a pile of Parm shaved onto your bowl of Chicken and Shrimp Carbonara. “All I said was ‘cheese grater.’ And she looked at me and said, ‘Give me one minute.’ They sold me the cheese grater. Not only that, they gave me cheese to try out.” The comments section showed a range of reactions, from those who wer shocked and delighted to folks who were already familiar with this phenomenon. “$15 cheese grater. $100 in Parmesan on the house. 😂😂,” joked one TikTok user. “Can you buy a napkin? A spoon? My new hobby might be trying to buy stuff from Olive Garden 😂,” commented another. A lot of commenters claiming to be current or former Olive Garden staff seemed to confirm this unofficial sales policy. “I’m a former Olive Garden waiter. Yes they will sell you anything that’s not nailed down to wall 🤣🤣,” commented one user. “Former Olive Garden employee — everything there as a price,” wrote another. “ One of my managers sold a painting off the wall once.” To find out for sure, we reached out to Olive Garden, who confirmed  that some of its restaurants do sell cheese graters and more. “The iconic Olive Garden cheese grater and our ‘Say When’ philosophy when grating fresh parmesan over our craveable Italian food is just one way we deliver on the never-ending abundance our guests love,” an Olive Garden spokesperson told TODAY.com at the time. “The ability to purchase the cheese grater varies by restaurant and availability.”  When asked if customers can purchase other things, like glassware and paintings, the spokesperson did not confirm individual items for sale, but said select items are available to purchase in-restaurant, depending on availability. But if you can’t wait for your next Olive Garden trip to get your hands on the cheese grater, you can now officially buy it online and have it shipped right to your doorstep — so you never have to “say when” again.

https://www.today.com/parents/dads/adam-sandler-kids-sunny-sadie-rcna101414,Adam Sandler's kids: Everything to know about Sadie and Sunny Sandler,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands For Adam Sandler, acting is a family business.  The actor, 57, his wife, Jackie, 49, and their daughters Sadie, 17, and Sunny, 15, stepped out on Nov. 19 for the premiere of “Leo,” an animated coming-of-age musical. Sandler co-wrote and stars in the Netflix film, while Jackie, Sadie and Sunny Sandler all voice characters.  Not only has Sadie inherited her dad’s love of show business, she shares his penchant for comfy footwear, and coordinated her green dress with white hightop sneakers. Jackie opted for an off-the-shoulder black minidress, while Sunny went with a long strapless gown. As for Sandler? He rocked his signature sweatpants, of course.  At the event,   asked Sandler whether he gives his kids career advice.  “I tell them to make sure you feel good about what you do and how hard you worked,” he told the publication. “You judge yourself. Don’t let many people try to get in your head. If you feel like you gave it your all, that’s all you can ask.” Jackie, who met Sandler on the set of 1999's ""Big Daddy,"" has had roles in number of her husband’s movies including, “Grown Ups” “50 First Dates” and “Blended.” “(It’s) always fun to be with my family,” Sandler told People. “It’s kind of what they are thinking about getting into and their passion, and so it’s good to learn with them.” Jackie, Sadie and Sunny all have starring roles in ""You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,"" which is based on the 2005 Fiona Rosenbloom novel of the same name.  , which Netflix released on Aug. 25, follows Stacy Friedman (played by Sunny) who is planning her ""kick a**"" bat mitzvah with her best friend, played by Samantha Lorraine. That is, until a boy comes between them, triggering a series of revenge schemes. Stacy's sister, played by real-life sister Sadie, and her dad, played by real-life dad Adam Sandler, are there to help. Idina Menzel plays Stacy's mom. The film is produced by Sandler's company, Happy Madison Productions.   The family drama that ensues will resonate with any parent who has planned a bat or bar mitzvah celebration (a Jewish coming-of-age milestone) or any parent who has a teenager. ""Leo"" and ""You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah"" aren't the first Sandler family project. Both daughters had roles in their dad's films ""Pixels"" (2015),  ""Jack and Jill"" (2011), ""Grown Ups"" (2010) and  ""Grown Ups 2"" (2013).  Sammi Cohen, who directed ""Bat Mitzvah,"" told "" "" that Sadie and Sunny ""work harder than most adults I know,"" adding of Sandler, ""He’s wearing multiple hats — producing, acting, being an actual dad. It’s almost inhuman."" Cohen also addressed accusations of Sander allowing his kids to be ""nepo babies,"" when children of celebrities have a career advantage due to their parents' success.   ""Sandler has a reputation for making movies with his friends, and that’s something we all want to do. What I say is, he’s still making movies with his friends, but they’re his kids,"" Cohen told the publication. ""He is the kind of dad who’s also your best friend. When it comes to the sort of chatter we’re hearing online, I don’t really think twice about it because I’m going like, 'Yeah, he’s doing the same thing he’s always done.'"" Here's more to know about Adam Sandler's two daughters.  Adam Sandler had dad jitters when his firstborn arrived.  “You know what was funny? When my kid was born, I was so nervous, I didn’t know what I felt,” he told ""Access Hollywood"" in  . “Five minutes later, maybe 10 minutes later, it was me and the kid and a nurse. We walked down alone to just check the vital signs and all that stuff, and I had a chemical reaction in my body, where I loved the kid so much, and I was so nervous for her, and that’s when I lost my mind for the kid.” “So, it took 10 minutes to become a good dad,” he added. “For the first 10 minutes, I was just lost.” Adam was ""dying"" to become a father,   in 2006, in part because it allowed him to nurture someone else.  ""I feel a little more relief that I don’t have to just think about myself too much anymore,"" he said. ""I don’t have to talk about how great I am."" Did he change diapers? “I get up with the wife while she’s doing the stuff,”   “Access Hollywood” later in the interview. “Try to help her. If she asks me to go get that ointment, I run out and get it, but that’s about it.”  Sandler said he was eager to share his work with Sadie when she reached a certain age.  Sadie's real-life bat mitzvah (a star-studded party with guests Conan O'Brien, Chris Rock and more) was a rite of passage for her dad, too.  ""She's doing great,"" he told   in 2012 of his eldest daughter. Although his little girl was growing up, she — and her dad — weren't ready to date, he made clear.  ""You know, I drive around with her (and her) friends and I hear them talking about boys now. It’s amazing, the feelings I had about the same boys. Five years ago, when they would mention the kid’s name, I would be like, ‘I love that kid.’ Now, I get very jumpy. ""They got little tiny mustaches and they're all a little tall and their bodies aren't making much sense,"" he added. ""And I see them make eye contact with my kid. It's very weird to see your kid lock eyes with a boy while they're talking. Just like, 'Whoa, you lock with daddy's eyes, man.'"" Sunny Sandler's real-life bat mitzvah in May 2022 was just as sparkly as her sister's, with Jennifer Aniston, David Spade and Taylor Lautner attending, reported  .  The guest of honor was also treated to a musical performance by Adam Levine, Sandler told Jimmy Kimmel.  Sunny has joined her parents on several red carpets, including for the June 26 premiere of "" "" (co-produced by her dad) and joining sister Sadie for the  in Paris.  Sunny also crashed her dad's   at home in 2020 — which seemed fair, considering she helped groom her dad before he went on TV.  ""I had a hair coming out of my ear, apparently, and Sunny told me about it,"" the ""Uncut Gems"" star told Kimmel. ""She said I looked goofy, so I went and shaved ... and then I came downstairs and said, 'How is that Sunny?' and she said, 'You're bleeding.'"" Sunny didn't stay long in the remote TV appearance, kissing her dad goodbye before going to do her homework.  When Kimmel asked whether Sandler was any help in that department, he was honest:  ""A little bit — not really,"" explaining that he had to tiptoe around his home to not disturb his children's remote classes.  ""I peek my head in on occasion and say hi to the teachers,"" he said.   Elise Solé is a writer and editor who lives in Los Angeles and covers parenting for TODAY Parents.

In a new interview with   published Nov. 20, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end recalled his and Swift's first date, which he says took place in New York (but keeps mum about   that actually happened).  “When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there,"" Kelce told WSJ. He said he managed to keep his nerves at bay, but his friends and family — not so much.  ""Everybody around me telling me:   And me sitting here saying:  .""  He also revealed that he's   with the ""kind of aura"" that Swift has, and reflected on how she manages to enjoy her life despite the ""scrutiny"" she regularly faces.  “Obviously I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I’ve never dealt with it,"" he shared during the interview. ""But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it…. The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange."" Read on for a timeline of their relationship so far. Taylor Swift, who was born in Pennsylvania, in 2020 released the song ""Gold Rush,"" which features the lyrics, ""My Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door."" During her May 12 Philadelphia stop on the ""Eras Tour,"" Swift cleared up speculation about the lyrics by  , not the ""Hotel California"" band.  “Guys, like, c’mon. I’m from Philly. Of course it’s the team,” she said onstage in a video   by the NFL. In February, Swift's team lost to the Kansas City Chiefs at the 2023 Super Bowl. The game made headlines for   in the championship game. Enter: Travis Kelce. Travis Kelce, on the heels of his Super Bowl victory over brother Jason Kelce, attended one of Swift’s “Eras Tour” concerts like millions of fans this summer. But while Swifties were looking forward to hearing some of the musician’s biggest hits, he arrived with a plan to get Swift’s attention. The athlete shared on the July 26 episode of the “New Heights” podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother, that he   and wanted to give it to Swift at one of her Arrowhead Stadium shows in Kansas City.  “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Travis Kelce explained on the podcast July 26.  He was bummed but still appreciated Swift’s impressive performance. “She doesn’t meet anybody or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal. But it was an unbelievable show,” he said.  Jason Kelce chimed in and joked, “She probably just hasn’t gotten over the Super Bowl yet. She’s a big Eagles fan, so maybe she just made something up and just didn’t want to talk to you.”  NFL Network reporter Andrew Siciliano in an Aug. 2 interview  .  As soon as Siciliano mentioned the “Anti-Hero” singer’s name in the video, Travis Kelce started laughing. The journalist then started to ask about his previous attempt to get Swift’s attention. “I said what I said,” Travis Kelce replied. “And I meant what I said when I said it.” He continued, “You know, what? It is what it is. I’m not going to talk about my personal life. I know what you writers want to hear. And you want to hear more about that, and I’m not going to give you anything.” Siciliano pressed on, wondering if Swift reached out to Travis Kelce.  “And that’s going to wrap it up here at NFL training camp,” he playfully said before the clip ended, skirting the question.  Kelce and Swift  before Swift attended the Chiefs-Bears game Sept. 24, a source close to the situation told TODAY — meaning they linked up sometime before the end of August. In September — two months after Travis Kelce said he tried to make a move on Swift — the dating rumors stayed strong, and Travis Kelce’s brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, weighed in on several occasions.  After Philadelphia defeated the Minnesota Vikings on Sept. 14, analyst and retired NFL star Tony Gonzalez   in an interview with Jason Kelce and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. He couched   by saying his 15-year-old daughter is “a big fan of a certain pop star.”  “You have a family member, a brother, and I’ve been hearing rumors. ... Can you comment?” he asked Jason Kelce. “I’ve seen these rumors,” the Jason Kelce responded. “I cannot comment.” He added, “Ever since ‘Catching Kelce,’ everybody’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life, so I don’t really know what’s going on there. I know Trav is having fun and we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with,” before laughing. (Travis Kelce’s search for love was documented on the E! reality series “Catching Kelce” in 2016.) He added, “Ever since ‘Catching Kelce,’ everybody’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life, so I don’t really know what’s going on there. I know Trav is having fun and we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with,” before laughing. (Travis Kelce’s search for love was documented on the E! reality series “Catching Kelce” in 2016.) Jason Kelce later backtracked  .  “Tony kind of blindsided me with that question on Thursday night,” he said. “It’s hard to answer because I don’t really know a lot about what’s happening with Travis’ love life. His business is his business. I stay out of that world. But having said that, I think he’s doing great. I think it’s all 100% true. I hope that this s--- goes a mile.” Travis Kelce's public attempt at courting Swift stoked rumors that the two might be romantically linked.  As a result, NFL commentators took every opportunity to link the pair together, even while Travis Kelce was playing on the field. “Touchdown, Travis Kelce! Kelce finds a blank space for the score,”   during the Kansas City Chiefs’ game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, Sept. 18, making a reference to Swift’s song “Blank Space.” Rich Eisen, host of the “Rich Eisen Show,” also took part in the fun on his show,   of several Swift song puns he was able to sneak into his program. “Even though that bone bruise and the injury one would think is delicate, he’s been able to shake it off,” Eisen said of Travis Kelce, referencing Swift’s songs “Delicate” and “Shake It Off.” In a Sept. 21 visit to “The Pat McAfee Show,” Travis Kelce responded to brother Jason’s comments to Tony Gonzalez the week before. “No one actually knows what’s going on, especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people both sides, he doesn’t know, it’s true, it’s this and that,” Travis Kelce said. “The guy is absolutely ridiculous, can’t stay out of the freaking headlines,” he joked. “Please everybody, stop asking my brother about my love life.” Travis Kelce also   head on. “I threw the ball in her court. I told her, I’ve seen you rock a stage in Arrowhead and you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,” he said. “We’ll see what happens in the near future.” McAfee, correctly, took this to mean that Swift would appear at an upcoming game. However, some of the show’s crew were left confused about the status of the rumored relationship. “All right, so we got to the bottom of it,” McAfee said after the interview. “Did we?” a co-host asked. During the game Sept. 24, Swift enthusiastically cheered for Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs  , Donna Kelce. In clips shared on ESPN’s  , Swift wore a red and white jacket and sported her signature red lipstick for the game.  Swift and Donna Kelce seemed to share a few laughs throughout the game.  The Fox broadcast also captured Swift throwing her hands in the air and celebrating when Travis Kelce scored a touchdown in the third quarter. The Grammy winner appeared to shout,   before excitedly banging her hands on the glass in the player’s box. During the game, Fox announcers repeatedly chimed in about the possible romance between Swift and Travis Kelce in between plays.  “I mean, I think the secret’s out,” one NFL commentator said.  On the   Travis Kelce reacted to the mania around Swift’s attendance at the Chiefs game. “I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. You know, the friends and family. She looked amazing,” he said. “Everybody was talking about her in a great light and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.” He said the experience marks “a game I’ll remember.”  “To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with mom, to see how Chiefs Kingdom was all excited that she was there, that s--- was absolutely hysterical,” Travis Kelce said. “It was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for damn sure.” “And then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end,” he added, using a Swift song title to reference the   in a convertible. But he also said he plans to keep his personal life private. “What’s real is that it’s my personal life and I want to respect both of our lives,” he said. “She’s not in the media as much as I am. “So everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports and saying, ‘All right now,’ would have to be kind of where I keep it.”  Swift attended at her second Chiefs game on Oct. 1 — this time at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where the Chiefs won 23-20 over the New York Jets. Swift was spotted at the game with an  , including Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Sophie Turner, Hugh Jackman and more. The night before the game, the singer was spotted grabbing dinner  , who’s married to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Swift   May 26, 27 and 28 on the “Eras Tour.” Back in August, sports reporters Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson had made a plea on their podcast to Taylor Swift to go out with Travis Kelce. In early October, amid all the frenzy around the Swift and Kelce, Thompson  . “Taylor, I don’t know what you are doing in your life right now besides rocking the world,” Andrews began  . “Please try our friend Travis. He is fantastic. ... Take us up on this, go on a date with this guy. Do it for America.” Thompson responded saying she was about to say the same thing. “Do it for yourself, do it for us and do it for the people, because there is no one that would give you a better time than this guy,” Thompson said.  on Oct. 2 with two laughing emoji. “You two are something else!!” he said, adding two raising hands emoji. “I owe you big time!!” , Andrews gushed about playing a small role in their romance. During a visit to TODAY on Oct. 6, Travis Kelce’s mom,   since being spotted with Taylor Swift at a Chiefs game while rumors of a relationship continue to swirl.  “It truly feels like I’m in some kind of an alternate universe,” Kelce said. “It’s just really, really strange, but it’s fun. It’s a great ride.” Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb couldn't help but ask about the possible romance.  Donna Kelce responded, “I honestly can’t tell you. It’s just too new.” While speaking to  , the NFL mom said she's seen some of the people son Travis Kelce has dated, but she doesn't think much about the kind of person he'll end up with. “I want to see that smile on his face, the brightness, the sparkle in his eyes, like Jason has,” she said, referring to  . “That’s what I want to see, and I hope I’ll see that some day.” During a   Oct. 6, the Chiefs tight end addressed the adjustment to the newfound fame and attention amid Swift's latest appearances, despite already being in the limelight following the 2023 Super Bowl.   “As all the attention comes, it feels like I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl and right now, even more on top of the world. So it’s fun,” he said.  Travis Kelce then said he's ""rolling with"" the constant attention from paparazzi and attempting to separate work and play.  “We’re learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place. But at the same time, it comes with it,” he continued. “You got a lot of people that care about Taylor for good reason. You just got to keep living and learning and enjoying the moments. At the end of the day, I’ve always been pretty good at compartmentalizing and being able to stay focused in this building.” Fresh off her red carpet appearance at the  , Swift was spotted back in the player’s box at Arrowhead Stadium Oct. 12 as    Wearing a black tank top and a red Chiefs jacket from Erin Andrews' brand, Swift cheered on Kelce’s team alongside his   and  .

While Travis Kelce was initially listed as ""questionable"" to play after a  , he had a season-high record game with nine catches for 124 yards. The Chiefs won 19-8. From Los Angeles, to Kansas City to New York: Swift and Travis Kelce showed up on ""Saturday Night Live"" in surprise appearances, and then hit Nobu in Midtown Manhattan for dinner. The pair were photographed walking hand-in-hand when they arrived and left. Photos and videos from paparazzi show that Travis Kelce held the door for Swift and helped her step out of the car. The two then interlocked fingers and went on their way.

Kelce shared on Oct. 20 that the first time he met Swift he was rocking a mustache, which is now “slowly starting to disappear.” “I’ll tell you what, man, that ‘stache and the 87 jersey was pretty iconic there for a little bit, and I had it when I met Taylor for the first time,” he said at a   ahead of Sunday’s Kansas City Chiefs game against the Los Angeles Chargers.  Since the moment they first met is not publicly known, this comment, of course, led Swifties to track down when exactly this could have been.  While the tight end notably had a mustache during Swift’s first game at Arrowhead Stadium back on Sept. 24, the mustache made its debut at training camp on Aug. 2,  Travis Kelce previously discussed the ‘stache on the   He said he has styled his facial hair that way every training camp for the past few years to imitate his coach. “Have you found out what Taylor Swift thinks of your mustache?” Jason Kelce cheekily asked, likely poking fun of his brother’s famous failed attempt   during her Kansas City stop on the “Eras Tour” in July. “Yeah, we’re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode, but something tells me she’s going to like it,” he responded. Swift attended the Chargers-Chiefs game on Oct. 22, marking her  . At the game, she wore a red Chiefs sweatshirt and gold friendship bracelet with the number 87, which is his jersey number. Kelce scored a touchdown in the second quarter, and the Chiefs won 31-17 — meaning the Chiefs at this point in the timeline are 4-0 with Swift in attendance. Swift and Kelce were also seen in   with Kelce’s teammate Mecole Hardman, Jr. and his girlfriend Chariah Gordon. Two of the pics show Swift smiling, while another shows her giving Kelce a sweet peck on the cheek while holding his shoulder. The photo sent the internet into overdrive as Swifties gushed over  . Swift and Kelce were spotted out on a date night in Kansas City on Oct. 24, according to photos published in  . The pair arrived at Argentinean steakhouse Piropos in Kelce's Rolls Royce, and dined for several hours, according to The Daily Mail. The publication reported the restaurant normally closes at 9 p.m., but stayed open late for the couple, who at one point were the sole customers in the establishment.  Swift and Kelce were seen holding hands when they left their romantic dinner, according to the photos. On the Oct. 25 episode of “New Heights,” Jason Kelce told his brother about his stats this season, which appear to improve when Swift is in attendance. “When T-Swift is at the game, you are averaging 99 yards, and when you are left with only your friends and remaining family there, you are at 46.5 yards,” he told his brother. Kelce said he liked  : “As it says in the edit or whatever, ‘Left to his own devices.’” “Well put,” he added. “It's kind of hard for me to wrap my head around that sentence, but yeah.” Swifties looked beyond the stats though, and began to fixate on how Jason Kelce appeared to inadvertently refer to Swift as family. “jason saying that when taylor isn’t at the game travis is only left with his 'remaining family' in attendance DID THEY JUST CALL TAYLOR FAMILY I AM NOT OKAY,” one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter. As Taylor Swift kicks off the South American leg of her ""Eras Tour,"" Travis Kelce traveled to Argentina Nov. 10, a source close to the couple confirms to NBC News.

Prior to his South American appearance, Kelce seemed to hint to his trip to Argentina during an episode of  .  “I might just say f--- it and just go somewhere nice,” the tight end said. “My skin’s getting really pale so I gotta go somewhere south, somewhere closer to the equator.” Kelce opened up about Swift's ""aura"" in an interview with  , saying that he's ""never dated"" anyone like her before.

https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/when-to-start-botox-rcna124171,4 dermatologists reveal the one sign that you’re ready for Botox,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Figuring out when to start Botox — or if a treatment like that is even right for you — can be more complicated than it seems. While there's no perfect age to start and everyone's experience is unique, experts say there are some signs that you keep an eye out for.  For Dr. Shasa Hu, the time to start getting Botox was at age 35 after her first pregnancy. ""After pregnancy, your body and  "" Hu, an associate professor in the department of dermatology and cutaneous surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com.  ""All of a sudden, you notice your facial aging is much more accelerated,"" she explains. ""So that's what I noticed I was starting to get a little bit of lines in between my eyebrows. I just looked tired."" Hu waited until she finished nursing her new baby and then started getting injections. Today, 12 years later, she has no regrets — and she still gets injections every four months.  ""I was never the type who wanted to freeze the aging process,"" she says. ""I always wanted to be proactive, but never wanted to be too overly aggressive about it."" Hu's experience mirrors that of many of her patients who are trying to decide when it's time to look into getting injections like Botox. Botox is an injected medication that's used to manage wrinkles and fine lines. It's also approved by the   to treat migraines, excessive sweating and other conditions.  While Botox is probably the most well-known neuromodulator, it's not the only one on the market. Other options you might come across at a dermatologist's office include Dysport, Daxxify, Xeomin and Jeuveau. Some of those products, also called neurotoxins, might cost more or last longer than others, but they all generally work the same way. ""They block the release of a specific neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) from your nerve and that prevents the contraction of a particular treated muscle,"" Dr. Joshua Zeichner, associate professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells TODAY.com. Depending on the amount of neurotoxin that's injected, ""it either softens the way that muscle contracts or completely paralyzes it,"" Dr. Evan Rieder, a dermatologist in New York City, tells TODAY.com. That essentially relaxes certain areas of facial muscles, Hu says, which then prevents the facial movements that contribute to what experts call dynamic wrinkles or dynamic expression lines.  There's no specific age that's considered the best or perfect time to start getting neurotoxin injections, the experts say.  ""The most common age group that I see is young women coming into the office for Botox for their 30th birthday,"" Zeichner says. ""That just seems to be a milestone for a lot of people."" But, he adds, that's not true for everyone. Dr. Fatima Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist in Michigan and founder of Dermy Doc Box, tells TODAY.com that she also most commonly sees patients in their 30s. But there's a wide range.  ""I see patients of all ages for first-time Botox in the clinic,"" she says, including people in their 20s and those in their 60s. The experts agree that there's really only one sign to look out for that you might be ready for Botox or another neurotoxin: When you notice the first signs of fine lines or wrinkles on your face at rest (meaning you're not making a facial expression), that's a good time to chat with a dermatologist. Most commonly, the first wrinkles people see forming are   on the forehead, vertical ""11 lines"" in the middle of the brow, fine lines around the eyes or ""bunny lines"" along the bridge of the nose. You should start the conversation when you first see those lines because, if you get neurotoxin soon enough, the lines can actually be reversed, Rieder says. ""However, with time and increased muscle activity and facial movements over months to years, those lines become permanently etched in,"" he explains.  At that point, ""they can be softened a little bit, but they'll never totally go away,"" he adds.  The effects of Botox-like injections typically last between three and five months, Zeichner says, while Rieder puts it at around four to six months. Other neurotoxins, like Daxxify, are marketed as longer-lasting alternatives to Botox, Hu says. Zeichner and Rieder both started getting Botox in their 30s during their time in medical school residency, Ziechner at Mount Sinai and Rieder at New York University. It’s not uncommon for residents in dermatology to “teach each other how to do it,” Ziechner explains.  “I have actually gone through my fair share of  from inexperienced co-resident injectors,” he says with a laugh. That experience, “and seeing what I liked and what I didn’t like, really shaped my injection patterns,” he adds. At the time, Rieder hadn’t even really considered whether or not he wanted it. “But once I had it, I was like, Oh, wow, I look a lot better now. And when I look in the mirror, I’m happier with what I’m seeing,” he recalls. Dr. Fahs also got Botox for the first time as a 27-year-old dermatology resident. ""We were receiving training on its proper use and I wanted to experience it first-hand to better be able to counsel and treat my patients,"" she explains. ""Needless to say, I’ve been hooked since then."" In particular, she uses neurotoxin to address her ""gummy smile"" by injecting it into the upper lip area. Doing so gave her a lot more confidence when smiling, she says. Now 33, Fahs injects herself every three to six months around the mouth and eyes, between the brows and in the forehead.  In recent years, another school of thought has emerged: preventive Botox, also called ""prejuvenation"" or ""baby Botox."" The idea here is exactly what it sounds like. Rather than waiting to treat wrinkles when they've already taken shape, some dermatologists use it   to prevent wrinkles from fully forming in the first place. This isn't a full treatment; preventive Botox usually requires a much smaller amount of product. ""They're coming in to get a tiny little sprinkle of Botox in key areas to prevent this from happening at all,"" Rieder explains. While some patients come in asking for this specifically, he adds, it's ""never something that I bring up."" Because the effects of neurotoxin typically last less than six months, it's something patients need to get regularly to keep up the effects. ""It will only work if you keep doing it,"" Hu explains. The cost of neuromodulator treatment, which is generally in the hundreds of dollars, may depend on your location, the provider that you're seeing, the specific product they're using and the amount of product needed for your desired results,  . ""If it's in your budget and it's something that you're interested in doing, I would encourage you to (consider neurotoxin) at the first sign that you're starting to develop a line,"" Zeichner says. ""But there's a difference between preventative Botox and presumptive Botox."" Fahs also reminds young patients that the ability to be expressive and emotive is important. ""Blunting this response at a young age isn’t natural,"" she says. ""A much more important preventative process for wrinkles is   to avoid the breakdown of collagen."" Still, everyone's skin and muscle movements are different, she adds. And some patients really do benefit from neuromodulators earlier in life than others. The best way to figure out if preventative Botox — or any Botox-like treatment — is right for you is to speak with a knowledgeable, experienced professional, the experts agree. ""The injection pattern and dosage that you get is really dependent on the style and aesthetic of your injector,"" Zeichner says. If you can, he suggests getting a word-of-mouth recommendation for someone whose work you've seen and liked. Ultimately, the experts say, the decision to start getting neuromodulator injections   that should be made with the input of a trusted expert. “Starting neurotoxin is a very personal decision and there isn’t one right way of deciding,” Fahs says. “After all, it isn’t a necessary procedure. So first and foremost, do it for yourself only.” © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Seventeen percent of those surveyed reported having “very positive” views of Swift, while 22% had “somewhat positive” views. Meanwhile, just 9% reported having “very negative” views, with 7% saying they have “somewhat negative” views of her. Swift is overwhelmingly well-known among voters. Ninety-four percent recognized her name when they were asked about her. Among all of the figures and groups tested in the poll — including President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, new House Speaker Mike Johnson, former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley — Swift had the highest net favorability rating. The poll also tested voters’ views of pop singer Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. Beyoncé, the “Single Ladies” vocalist, had a high name ID similar to Swift’s — 92% of voters know who she is. And 33% of voters reported positive views of her, while 40% said they view her neutrally and 20% said they have negative views of her. Both women had higher negative ratings from one group: Republicans. Thirty-four percent of GOP voters said they view Beyoncé negatively, while 16% said they view her positively. Swift has a net positive rating among GOP voters, albeit by a small margin. Twenty-eight percent of Republicans say they view her positively, while 26% say they view her negatively. By contrast, 52% of Democrats view Beyoncé positively, and 53% view Swift positively. Just 5% of Democrats give each singer negative ratings. Swift’s highest positive ratings came from Democrats, but another subgroup — women — also rated her especially highly. Forty-four percent of all female voters surveyed said they view her positively, and 15% said they have negative views of her. Black voters gave Beyoncé the highest favorability ratings, with 57% saying they view her favorably and just 11% saying they view her negatively. Both singers have been popular for decades, and they each attracted thousands of fans spanning all ages to their popular Eras and Renaissance tours this year. Recently, Swift has also drawn headlines because of her budding romance with football player Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs. Neither Swift nor Beyoncé have ever run for office or indicated that they ever would, though they’ve each dipped a toe in politics in some way. In 2018, Swift   a pair of Tennessee Democrats in the midterm elections: then-Rep. Jim Cooper for Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District and Phil Bredesen for the Senate as he ran against now-Sen.

Still, both singers remain wildly popular and recognizable figures among the American electorate. The pair “have the ability and influence to reach Americans in ways that our national leaders cannot,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research, who conducted the poll alongside Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. “They may tell us to look back at 2023 and advise us all to, respectively, put the year ‘in a box to the left’ and ‘shake it off’ to get ready for a wild ride in 2024.” Alexandra Marquez is a researcher for the political unit. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

https://www.today.com/popculture/news/shakira-reaches-deal-spanish-prosecutors-tax-fraud-trial-rcna125958,Shakira reaches a deal with Spanish prosecutors on the first day of tax fraud trial,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — After having maintained her innocence for nearly five years, pop star   struck a last-minute deal to avoid the risk of going to prison on the opening day of her tax fraud trial in Barcelona on Monday. Shakira told the presiding magistrate, José Manuel del Amo, that she accepted the agreement reached with prosecutors. She answered “yes” to confirm her acknowledgement of six counts of   the Spanish government 14.5 million euros (about $15.8 million) in taxes between 2012 and 2014. Under the deal, Shakira is to receive a suspended three-year sentence and a fine of 7 million euros ($7.6 million). The trial, which would have included more than 100 witnesses over the following weeks, was instead called off after just eight minutes. Prosecutors said in July that they would seek a prison sentence of eight years and two months and a fine of 24 million euros ($26 million) for the singer, who has won over fans worldwide for her hits in Spanish and English in different musical genres. Shakira said in a statement to NBC News provided by her public relations firm that she had wanted to fight on but put her family, career and peace of mind first.  “Throughout my career, I have always strived to do what’s right and set a positive example for others. That often means taking the extra step in business and personal financial decisions to procure the absolute best counsel, including seeking the advice of the world’s preeminent tax authorities such as PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited, who advised me from the start, and subsequently Ernst & Young Global Limited. Unfortunately, and despite these efforts, tax authorities in Spain pursued a case against me as they have against many professional athletes and other high-profile individuals, draining those people’s energy, time, and tranquility for years at a time. While I was determined to defend my innocence in a trial that my lawyers were confident would have ruled in my favor, I have made the decision to finally resolve this matter with the best interest of my kids at heart who do not want to see their mom sacrifice her personal well-being in this fight. I need to move past the stress and emotional toll of the last several years and focus on the things I love — my kids and all the opportunities to come in my career, including my upcoming world tour and my new album, both of which I am extremely excited about. I admire tremendously those who have fought these injustices to the end, but for me, today, winning is getting my time back for my kids and my career.” The case hinged on where Shakira, now 46, lived during that period. Prosecutors in Barcelona have alleged that the Colombian singer spent more than half of that period in Spain and therefore should have paid taxes on her worldwide income in the country even though her official residence was still in the Bahamas. Tax rates are much lower in the Bahamas than in Spain. The multiple Grammy and Latin Grammy winner waved and blew a kiss to a small crowd of bystanders before entering the courthouse. She briefly sat in front of the panel of judges, flanked by teams of prosecutors on one side and the defense on the other. “This has been a difficult decision that took time to reach,” defense lawyer Miriam Company told reporters. “Her legal team had prepared the trial and were convinced we could demonstrate her innocence, but the circumstances changed and (Shakira) opted to accept the deal.” Shakira turned down a deal offered to her by prosecutors to settle her case in July 2022, saying, via her Spanish public relations firm Llorente y Cuenca, that she “believes in her innocence and chooses to leave the issue in the hands of the law.” The details of that potential deal were not made public. Shakira was named in the “Paradise Papers” leaks that detailed the offshore tax arrangements of numerous high-profile individuals, including musical celebrities such as Madonna and U2’s Bono. Shakira’s public relations firm had previously said that she had already paid all that she owed and an additional 3 million euros (about $3.2 million) in interest. The defense team for Shakira, the Barcelona firm Molins Defensa Penal, said in November 2022 that she had not spent more than 60 days a year inside the country during the period in question, adding she would have needed to have spent half the year in Spain to be considered a fiscal resident. Her defense argued that she was away from Barcelona for long stretches on a world tour in 2011 and then spent a lot of time in the United States as part of a jury for the NBC television music talent show The Voice. Spanish prosecutors disagreed, and the investigating judge, Marco Juberías, wrote in 2021 on the conclusion of a three-year probe into the charges that he found there existed “sufficient evidence of criminality” for the case to go to trial. Shakira defended her innocence when she was questioned by Juberías in 2019. She lost an appeal to have the case thrown out last year. Shakira established her fiscal residency in Spain in 2014 at the same time her oldest child was enrolled in school in Barcelona, according to her defense team, as she was going to spend more time in the country with her family. In Spain, an investigative judge carries out an initial probe and decides either to throw the case out or send it to trial. A court can waive prison time for first-time offenders if they are sentenced to less than two years behind bars. In  , Spanish state prosecutors charged Shakira in September with alleged evasion of 6.7 million euros in tax on her 2018 income. They accused her of using an offshore company based in a tax haven to avoid paying the tax. Spain has cracked down on soccer stars such as   and   over the past decade for not paying their full taxes. The former Barcelona and Real Madrid stars were found guilty of evasion but both avoided prison time after their sentences were suspended. Shakira, whose full name is Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, has two children, Milan and Sasha, with Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqué. The couple lived together in Barcelona before   last year. Since then, she has resided in Miami. After   gala in Seville on Thursday, Shakira thanked her fans in Spain for “being with me in the good times and the bad.” © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

https://www.today.com/popculture/news/jimmy-carter-rosalynn-carter-relationship-timeline-rcna101205,Jimmy Carter says wife Rosalynn was his 'equal partner’ following her death,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Former President Jimmy Carter is speaking out about the love he had for his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who   in Plains, Georgia, on Nov. 19 at the age of 96, according to the  . “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” President Carter said in a statement. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.” The pair entered hospice care within months of each other. The former president, 99,   in February, the Carter Center said, and the former first lady entered hospice care earlier this month,  .  The Carters were married for 77 years, and the decadeslong love story between them is one for the ages. He met the former first lady, who was born Eleanor Rosalynn Smith, when Rosalynn was a newborn. They fell in love as teenagers and tied the knot in 1946.  The longest-married couple in presidential history, the Carters, who celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary in July, share four children: sons John (also known as Jack), 76, James (aka Chip), 73, and Donnel (aka Jeff), 71, and daughter Amy, 55. The couple's marriage has been celebrated as both a loving union that's endured despite the challenges of public office, and as a model for a modern partnership that has a flipped gender norms on its head. “Over the years, we became not only friends and lovers, but partners,” Rosalynn Carter said at her husband's 90th birthday celebration in 2014, according to  . “He has always thought I could do anything, and because of that, I/we have had some wonderful adventures and challenges.” “It’s a full partnership,” Jimmy Carter told   during a joint interview with his wife just before the couple’s 75th wedding anniversary on July 7, 2021. In some ways, the Carters' love story seems like destiny. Jimmy Carter's parents, who lived in the small town of Plains, Georgia, were friendly with the parents of Rosalynn Carter, who lived next door. In August 1927, Jimmy Carter's mom, registered nurse Lillian Carter, delivered newborn Rosalynn inside the Smith family home, according to  . Jimmy Carter, then just 3, met baby Rosalynn soon after. “He looked through the cradle bars and saw me,” Rosalynn Carter told   in 2021. By the time she was a teenager, Rosalynn Carter had a crush on Jimmy Carter, who was then a ""worldly"" midshipman in the U.S. Naval Academy, she told The Washington Post. Jimmy Carter wrote in his 2015 memoir, ""A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety,"" about one night in particular when he knew Rosalynn was the one for him. On the last day of a monthlong leave home from the academy, Jimmy Carter, who was dating a beauty pageant winner at the time, went driving around town with his sister Ruth's boyfriend. They spotted Rosalynn standing outside the Methodist Church and invited her to join them to see a movie. At breakfast the next morning, Jimmy Carter gushed about Rosalynn to his mom. ""She's the one I'm going to marry,"" he said. In his memoir, Jimmy Carter revealed that he was captivated by his future wife's beauty and brains. ""Rosalynn was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussions on the rumble seat of the Ford Coupe,"" he wrote in his memoir. The former president told The Washington Post that he believed the couple's marriage, which took place in July 1946 when he was 21 and she was 18, was meant to be.  ""I’ve always thought that,"" he said. The young military couple began married life on the Navy base in Norfolk, Virginia, later moving to other bases in Honolulu and San Diego. Jimmy Carter was a young lieutenant and his wife a stay-at-home mom to the pair's sons. The couple later welcomed their only daughter, Amy, in 1967. The couple had no intentions to return to Plains but in 1953, Jimmy Carter's father, James Earl Carter Sr., died, leaving behind the family’s farming and warehouse enterprise.  Without consulting his wife, Jimmy Carter decided to leave the Navy and return with his family back to Georgia, where he would take over the family business, according to  . Jimmy Carter told   that the couple's marriage style was typical of the times. “I was the boss,"" he explained. “The first part of our life, I dominated everything, except the household, which Rosalynn ran,” he said. Jimmy Carter, who over the years became an outspoken advocate for women's rights, added that, looking back, he couldn't believe he didn't consult with Rosalynn Carter about his early professional decisions. “I know better now!” he said. The Carters told   in the joint interview in 2021 that Rosalynn Carter became a key partner in the family's farming business. “We developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business, and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics,” said Rosalynn Carter. “I knew more on paper about the business than he did. He would take my advice about things."" The couple took that partnership style into politics when Jimmy Carter entered office in the early 1960s. He served as a Georgia state senator from 1963 until 1967 and as governor of Georgia from 1971 until 1975 before making his way to the White House as the 39th president from 1977 until 1981. Rosalynn Carter proved to be a capable campaigner and policy advocate.  “I love it. I love campaigning,"" the former first lady told The Associated Press. ""I had the best time. I was in all the states in the United States. I campaigned solid every day the last time we ran."" The couple's son James Carter, who goes by the nickname Chip, told The Washington Post that his mom was instrumental in getting his father elected. ""Dad started to change when he ran for governor, because Mom was a much better politician than he was,” he said. “She cared about him getting elected and reelected, and he cared about the Panama Canal.” Jimmy Carter regarded Rosalynn Carter as an unofficial adviser during his years in the White House, even asking her to attend cabinet meetings. The couple told   that while in the White House, they frequently discussed — and disagreed about — the policies of the Carter administration over one-on-one lunches every Thursday in the Oval Office. “She opposed my policies a lot when I was in the White House, but never publicly,” said the former president. “We would sit on the Truman Balcony in the afternoon and talk about what we did,” said Rosalynn Carter. “I told him what I thought.” Jimmy Carter served only one term in the White House, losing the 1980 presidential election to his opponent, Ronald Reagan. After he and Rosalynn Carter left politics, they returned to their hometown of Plains. The inseparable couple, then in their mid-50s, devoted themselves to humanitarian work. In 1982, they founded the Carter Center, a not-for-profit human rights organization. The couple are also perhaps the most famous volunteers for Habitat for Humanity, and have been photographed joining the organization as it builds houses around the world. In 2002, Jimmy Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work “to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development” through the Carter Center. The longest-living president in U.S. history, Jimmy Carter and his wife of nearly 80 years have remained devoted to one another as each has faced illness in their senior years.

Happy 2nd birthday my beautiful Penelope,” she wrote in a  , sharing a carousel of cute moments with her daughter.  “Life is so much more colourful with you in it,” she continued in her post. “You are the most special human being I know and the love of my life ❤️ You will forever be my baby.” She also called herself her daughter’s “biggest supporter” in an Instagram post for Penelope’s 3rd birthday in 2022.  “Exactly 3 years ago, right before midnight, you came into my life and rocked my world forever,” Piquet captioned   of what appeared to be the toddler’s mermaid-themed birthday party.  “You are the most special human being I know and you teach me every day.” Verstappen has opened up about his relationship with Piquet’s daughter. “I’m not the father, that’s not the aim,” he told   in a November 2023 interview. “It’s always very important that she has a good relationship with her own father, which she has. But I see her every day when I’m at home. We get on very well. She’s very cute.”   He also celebrated Piquet’s parenting in an   last year. “Happy Mothers Day to these amazing mothers,” he captioned the May 2022 post, sharing a photo of Piquet with his own mother, Sophie Kumpen, and his sister, Victoria-Jane Verstappen. Piquet is no stranger to the world of professional race car driving. Her dad, Nelson Piquet, 71, is a legendary former driver who won the Formula One World Drivers’ Championships in 1981, 1983 and 1987.  Her brother, Nelson Piquet Jr., 38, is also a professional stock car racer, and former Formula One, Formula E and NASCAR driver. She formed some of her earliest memories on the race track, as she told   in December 2022. “He took up karting and was immediately obsessed,” she told the magazine, per Google Translate. “They are fond memories, the afternoons I spent after school at the go-kart track watching him go round and round until the sun set.” Piquet’s father pops up in her Instagram photos from time to time.  In a   from August 2020, her dad balances a baby, who appears to be Penelope, on his lap while the baby holds onto the wheel of a vintage-looking race car. “Missing grandpa,” Piquet wrote in the caption, along with a heart emoji. Piquet also celebrated her relationship with her big brother in a sweet   for his birthday in June 2020. “Happy Birthday @piquetjr,” she wrote in the caption, sharing a slideshow of throwback photos from their childhood. “You are and will always be my first bully ♥️😂 #35.” As Piquet told Vogue Netherlands, growing up in a racing family gave her an inside understanding of the demands on professional race car drivers.  “I was always very involved in my brother’s career. I’ve been through the ups and downs, seeing what pressure does to someone,” she said. “This world is so familiar to me, I know what those boys are going through.” That said, despite her close connections to racing — through her family, as well as through Verstappen and her former partner, professional driver Daniil Kvyat — Piquet emphasized that she has her own identity and ambitions outside the racing world. “Ultimately this is Max’s work. Would you normally bring your girlfriend or partner to the office?” she told Vogue Netherlands. “I want to wake up every day with the feeling: today I am going to achieve something — otherwise you will lose your strength, your energy, your light,” she added. “I am a happy and grateful person.” Piquet was born in Germany to a Dutch mother and a Brazilian father, she shared in a   for Marie Claire Brazil.  She also said in her column that she spent much of her childhood in the south of France, then lived in Brazil from age 12 to 15.  Piquet then spent time in France, Brazil and England throughout her teen years before moving to New York City to attend Marymount Manhattan College, where she earned a degree in international relations with an emphasis on political science and economics. Piquet speaks English, French and Portuguese, as well as some Spanish and Italian, according to her  .  Her profile also notes that she spent three months volunteering at an orphanage in Tanzania. Today, Piquet lives with Verstappen in Monaco, a small principality bordered by France on the Mediterranean Sea.  Piquet is a model, and has worked with brands including  ,  , and  .  While she may be best known for her modeling work, she has worn multiple hats throughout her career. In the years after college, she interned with Bergdorf Goodman, worked as an assistant stylist for Vogue, and later worked as a marketing coordinator, according to her LinkedIn profile. Piquet also worked behind the scenes in the racing world, serving as a social media and PR consultant for Formula E for nearly two years. “I consider myself to be a highly eclectic person in every way, and highly adaptable,” Piquet wrote in a  . “I get along with everyone and I have great appreciation for different cultures.  “I have worked in so many different areas of fashion such as magazine (sic), public relations, marketing, social media, as well as in the motorsport world generating online content,” she added.  Piquet often takes to Instagram to celebrate Verstappen’s racing achievements.  “What a privilege to witness you claiming not one but THREE WORLD TITLES,” she wrote in an   after Verstappen won his third World Drivers’ Championship at the Qatar Grand Prix. “What you have achieved is truly spectacular and you keep amazing us,” she continued. “I am proud beyond words and hope you enjoy every single moment ❤️.” Last October, when Verstappen won his second world championship, Piquet   of herself kissing her boyfriend on the cheek as he held his trophy. “He did it again ✌🏻⭐️⭐,” she wrote in the caption.  Not all of her posts about Verstappen are racing related. In September 2021, she shared a   with her boyfriend in honor of his 24th birthday. “Happy Birthday to the love of my life,” she wrote in the caption. “I love everything about you, about us and I am beyond proud of you.

https://www.today.com/popculture/colleen-ballinger-returns-internet-viral-ukulele-video-rcna125925,Colleen Ballinger returns to the internet months after viral ukulele video,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Nearly five months after her widely criticized ukulele apology went viral, YouTuber Colleen Ballinger has ventured back into the public eye — to mixed reactions. Following escalating allegations that she engaged in inappropriate interactions with underage fans, Ballinger, 36, had uploaded a video to her video blog channel in June titled, “ .” In it, she strummed a ukulele while   through a 10-minute song about “the toxic gossip train.” The video became one of the most heavily condemned and ridiculed apologies on the internet, with many calling Ballinger out for appearing to make a mockery of serious allegations. “I just wanted to say that the only thing I’ve ever groomed is my two Persian cats,” Ballinger sang. “I’m not a groomer. I’m just a loser who didn’t understand I shouldn’t respond to fans.” Then, she disappeared from the internet until Saturday, when she dropped a video titled, “ ,” in which she spends the first several minutes apologizing for her past behavior before transitioning into a vlog of her day. “Obviously, the last video that I posted on here is really embarrassing, to say the least,” Ballinger said in the video. “I was being accused of some pretty awful things and I just was mad and I should have handled that situation with maturity and empathy, but instead I just let my ego take over and I’m really disappointed in myself.” She went on to say that she feels “terrible” about having caused hurt at times when she “did not put enough thought” into her interactions with fans. She also apologized to those disappointed by her silence over the last few months, saying she needed time to listen and learn in order to “create a positive, kind, inclusive, safe space online” moving forward. “I do not expect anyone to welcome me back with open arms,” she said. “I don’t expect to change anyone’s mind with this video. I just wanted to come on here and say that I’m sorry.” Ballinger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The YouTuber had risen to fame for her satirical alter ego Miranda Sings, a silly character with a bizarre singing style and lack of self-awareness. Since creating the character in 2008, she has amassed a following of more than 22 million subscribers across three YouTube channels. She also had a Netflix show that ran for two seasons, as well as a comedy special on the platform. Allegations about Ballinger’s behavior had surfaced as early as 2020, when YouTuber Adam McIntyre made a video claiming she formed an inappropriate friendship with him when he was 13 to 16 years old and sent him lingerie as a joke. At the time, Ballinger responded to some of McIntyre’s allegations in a video titled, “ .” McIntyre’s   this month after another YouTube creator, KodeeRants, who called McIntyre a liar in 2020, made a now-deleted video showing purported screenshots of Ballinger asking a group chat about members’ “favorite position” and suggesting McIntyre include a question in a Q&A on his channel about whether or not the then-teen was a virgin. Though fans left comments on Ballinger’s return vlog about how much they’ve missed her, others online aren’t quite willing to welcome her back — with many immediately lambasting her new video. “colleen ballinger thinking she can just come back to the internet with a ‘sincere’ (using that word VERY loosely) apology and then ending the apology video with a regular vlog is… bizarre at best,” one user   on X. “the apology should’ve come four months ago, but instead we got mocked.” Some also expressed suspicion that Ballinger’s return coincides with the time of year when creators tend to see the highest earnings from YouTube ads, as brands begin to buy more ad space in preparation for the holidays. “colleen ballinger returning to youtube as soon as the highest vlogger adsense season is about to start,” one X user  , attaching a video to complete the meme. The video also sparked a flurry of discourse on the subreddit r/ColleenBallingerSnark, a community dedicated to discussing Ballinger and those associated with her. Despite mainly skeptical reactions across the internet, Ballinger was much more warmly received on her personal social media profiles and in her YouTube comments. “I was actually just thinking about you with the twins and your birthdays. I’m so happy you’re doing better and actively working on improving yourself,” one commenter wrote on her “fall vlog” video. “It’s never too late to grow as a person. Loving the short hair era. Welcome back ❤” Still, some fans say they are hesitant to offer their support. “I’m really feeling torn. Used to be a huge fan, was pretty upset to see all the things that came out about you. I’m happy to know that you are doing well,” read another popular comment on the video. “I feel like apology was sincere but i want to see accountability, and whether it is public or private apologies to those involved. I hope this is a new start on a healthier path.” Angela Yang is an intern for NBC News' diversity verticals. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

She was 96. The   confirmed in a statement that Rosalynn Carter died at her home in Plains, Georgia, with her family beside her. Rosalynn Carter was married to 39th President Jimmy Carter for 77 years. The former president is 99 years old. ""Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,"" President Carter said in a statement. ""She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.""  Chip Carter, the couple's 73-year-old son, said, ""Besides being a loving mother and extraordinary First Lady, my mother was a great humanitarian in her own right. Her life of service and compassion was an example for all Americans."" He added, ""She will be sorely missed not only by our family but by the many people who have better mental health care and access to resources for caregiving today.""  The news of Rosalynn Carter's death comes two days after   reported that she had entered hospice care at her home. Her family also shared earlier this year that the former first lady had  .  Jimmy Carter is currently receiving   at their home. Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born in Plains, Georgia, in 1927. The eldest daughter of a God-fearing family that lived on a humble farm, she was encouraged to pursue an education. Carter's father, Wilburn Edgar Smith, owned an auto repair shop and was also a bus driver. Her mother, Allie M. Smith, worked as a teacher and became a dressmaker following Smith's death. At the time, the future first lady was just 13 years old.  In 1984, Carter published her autobiography "" "" and wrote about having grown up three miles away from her future husband. Carter also reflected on the impacts of growing up in the segregated South, an issue that would inspire the couple's politics and interest well into their years in the White House. Well before they would become a political team, Carter and Jimmy were children of two separate families that were also particularly close. In addition to being childhood best friends with Jimmy's younger sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton, the late first lady had a younger sister, Lillian Allethea Smith Wall, who was partly named after the Carter family's matriarch Lillian Gordy Carter.  In ""First Lady from Plains,"" Carter described 1944 as ""the year I fell in love with Jimmy's picture.""  At the time, the future president was enrolled at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. She became infatuated with a photo that Ruth had pinned up on her bedroom wall. “Plotting a fantasy romance with him became a great game between Ruth and me,” she wrote. In the summer of 1945, when Rosalynn Carter was 17 and her future husband was 20, the two were reunited thanks to the efforts of Ruth. While on school leave, Jimmy Carter invited her to see a movie with Ruth and her boyfriend at the time. Of the experience, Rosalynn Carter wrote in her autobiography, ""I have no idea what movie we saw. My mind was somewhere else. After dreaming about him for so long, I was actually with him, and it couldn’t have been more wonderful."" That Christmas, Rosalynn Carter turned down his proposal so that she could continue her education. In July 1946, after they both graduated from their prospective schools and she was 18, they wed. A year later, the Carters began their family. With Jimmy chasing a career in the Navy and Carter following closely behind him, each of their children would be born across the United States. In Virginia in 1947, Carter welcomed their first child, a son named John William “Jack.”  Later, they had James Earl “Chip” III in 1950 in Hawaii. Donnel Jeffrey “Jeff” was born in Connecticut in 1952. Finally — following the death of Jimmy's father — the couple returned to Georgia, where they had a girl, Amy Lynn, born in 1967. By 1970, Carter had helped secure her husband's career in politics. That year, he won the Georgia governorship as a Democrat, and Carter became First Lady of Georgia. A shy woman, Carter wrote in her autobiography of her early struggle with being in the public eye. This proved to be a particular challenge she would work to overcome as she increasingly stepped in for her husband for public appearances. “Suddenly, everyone was looking at me, and I was too proud to tell them I was too scared to speak,"" she recalled of her first time speaking at a rally on his behalf. ""On the way to the rally, where I had to take my turn with all of them- all men, including Lester Maddox, who was running for lieutenant governor-- the pressure and nervousness got the better of me. As we reached the city limits, I said... 'Stop the car, I’m going to be sick.' And I was. It got much easier for me, though, and before the campaign was over, I was making brief speeches often.” In 1977, Jimmy Carter became the 39th President of the United States. During her husband's presidency, it became clear that the little girl from the South who once lived in poverty could not be taken out of the woman who would run the White House.  Feminine and practical, Carter came to be described as a “steel magnolia” by the press during her time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. To this, she replied in her autobiography as being ""just as well.""  ""Once something is printed, it repeats and repeats,"" she wrote. ""I had the reputation of being frugal, for example, because someone wrote while Jimmy was governor that I was so stingy I would hire anyone to cut the grass at the Governor’s Mansion, and I put cows on the lawn to graze instead. I hope I am frugal, but I never thought of putting cows on the lawn!"" As a proponent of the equal rights movement, Carter was known for making straightforward feminist statements. Carter famously re-wore   that she had first worn to her husband’s 1971 inauguration ball as governor for his presidential inaugural ball.  In 1979,   reported that she addressed a group of professional women at an awards luncheon and spoke about sexism and how it affected her role as First Lady. She described the media as being ""not very interested"" in her focus on mental health, seniors and the underprivileged because they were viewed as not “sexy.”   As part of her duties, Carter threw herself into social obligations and cabinet meetings. She set a new standard in   of the White House. Continuing with her early focus as the First Lady of Georgia — as First Lady of the U.S., Carter made mental health her focus. She served as the honorary chair of the President's Commission on Mental Health. She campaigned for her husband's re-election for a second presidential term in the 1980 election. Ultimately, he lost to the Republican Party's Ronald Reagan. Following the defeat, the Carters returned to Georgia once again. This time, they were in low spirits and in serious debt. In an interview with the  , the president recalled how they returned to find his peanut business $1 million in debt after it had been held in a blind trust throughout his presidency.  To make money, the couple began to write books. Jimmy became the author of 30 published books. By 2010, Carter published, ""Within Our Reach: Ending the Mental Health Crisis.""  In 1982, Carter and her husband partnered with Emory University to found The Carter Center, a private, not-for-profit aiming to advance human rights and stop human suffering. Like her days as a new bride, Carter remained at her husband's side after it was announced in 2023 that  . That same year,  .

The pair have been dominating headlines as Swift makes appearances at Chiefs’ games to cheer on Kelce and his squad. Broadcast cameras quickly cut to the “Anti-Hero” singer to see her reactions after big plays and her interactions with new friends like Brittany Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes’ wife, which quickly trend on social media. Multiple NFL players, including the Chiefs’ Super Bowl-winning quarterback, have weighed in on Kelce’s love life. Ahead of the  on Nov. 20, Patrick Mahomes shared his opinion on how he and his teammates feel about Kelce’s personal life becoming a trending topic. During an interview with ESPN’s Jeff Darlington on   Nov. 17, Patrick Mahomes was asked if the current media attention the team is receiving is comparable to the coverage they received after winning a Super Bowl. “I don’t think it feels any different,” he replied. “People see the whole Taylor Swift and Travis (thing) and they make it a huge deal because it is a huge deal. I think it becomes a bigger deal to the fan bases than it does to the guys who are actually in the building.” He praised Swift and said her interactions with the team are not a “distraction.” “I’ve been lucky enough to meet Taylor and see how good of a person she is. I think you understand why it’s not become a distraction or anything like that because everybody cares about being the best they can be every day,” he continued.  Patrick Mahomes also seemed to imply he is a Swiftie. He said he might take a trip to Europe or another international location to see the singer’s “Eras Tour” when the NFL offseason rolls around next year.  Kelce has already had the opportunity to see the show in person a couple times. He was in attendance at Swift’s Nov. 11 show in Buenos Aires when she    Speaking of Kelce, Patrick Mahomes also gushed about his longtime teammate, calling him his “brother.”  “I mean, I talk about his family and my family have almost become one family because of the relationship that we have and how we’ve kind of (become these) brothers on the football field but off the football field, as well,” he shared.  The quarterback complimented Kelce for not trying to be a star or the center of attention.  “He doesn’t try to be this Travis Kelce ‘Saturday Night Live,’ guy,” Patrick Mahomes added, referencing the tight end’s  . “He just wants to be the guy who comes to play football every single day.” He told Darlington that that competitive nature is why they get along so well and why Kelce has strong bonds with their other teammates, too. Patrick Mahomes explained, “I think that’s what makes him so special and why guys really gravitate toward him. We both love winning, and we love competing, and I think that’s what makes us have that same wavelength on the football field — is we’re going to compete until the very end.” He said the entire team is looking forward to hopefully returning and winning Super Bowl LVII on Feb. 11, 2024.  The superstar athlete’s comments on “NFL Live” are the most he has spoken about the potential relationship between Kelce and Swift. He has shared few details about the two over the past few months.  In September, reporters asked him about   in the Chiefs’ win over the Chicago Bears.  “I heard she was in the house,” he said at the time. “I felt a little bit of pressure, and so I knew I had to get it to Trav.”  He added that Swift was “tremendous at everything she does” and he looked forward to meeting her.  A couple days later,   at an afterparty to celebrate the Chiefs’ win.  “She’s really cool. Good people,” Patrick Mahomes told reporters. But, he was tight-lipped about their interaction.  “Like Trav said, (I’ll) let them have their privacy, and keep it moving,” he said.

https://www.today.com/news/aclu-demands-kansas-school-change-policy-rcna125904,ACLU demands Kansas school change policy that allegedly forced Native American child to cut his hair,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The American Civil Liberties Union is demanding that a Kansas elementary school repeal a policy it says forbids boys from wearing long hair after an 8-year-old Native American student was allegedly forced to cut his or be sent home. In a letter sent Friday to R.V. Haderlein Elementary School in Girard, Kansas, the ACLU said that the boy in question, a member of the Wyandotte Nation, grew his hair out last summer after attending his nation’s Gathering of the Little Turtles, where he saw other Native men wearing their hair long. This allegedly violated Haderlein’s “Boy’s Hair Length” policy — a policy that does not apply to girls at the school. As a result, the ACLU says, the boy was told in August he needed to cut his hair or be sent home until he does. According to the letter, his mother visited the school in early September to request an exemption, even offering to show documentation proving the child’s Native heritage. She was informed there were no exemptions, the ACLU says, and after numerous failed attempts to contact the superintendent, she made the decision to have her child’s hair cut so he could keep attending school. “Because he made the decision to wear his hair long in accordance with his Native American spiritual and cultural tradition,” the letter states, “cutting his hair in this manner caused him distress.” The ACLU maintains that this policy as applied to the child violates state and federal law, and constitutes religious as well as sex-based discrimination. “Requiring him to cut his hair to attend school imposes a substantial burden on his faith practice because, in and of itself, it violates his religious beliefs,” the letter states. It also promotes “rigid views of gender norms and roles,” and is unlawful because “schools may not impose different requirements on students based on their sex without an exceedingly persuasive justification.” The policy is particularly troubling, the letter says, given the historical context of Indian boarding schools in this country, which stripped Native American children of their identities by, among other abuses, cutting their hair. The letter urges the school district to rescind the hair-length policy in its entirety, or grant an immediate exception to the Native American child. It asks the school to let the ACLU know by Dec. 1 whether it plans to honor this request. The school could not immediately be reached for comment.

Ross Jr. was initially charged only with first-degree kidnapping in the abduction of the girl on Sept. 30 from Moreau Lake State Park, located in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains about 35 miles north of Albany.

That comes through right away.”  Ed Kelce then revealed ""something very special"" that he noticed about Swift the first time they met.  “We’re sitting in the suite, she gets up and in the front room, she gets up to go get a drink or something and she starts picking up empty bottles, cans, plates that are scattered around. Because in the suites everybody gets stuff and you empty it down wherever you can,” he said, adding that he thought that was unexpected given her level of fame.   “And I’m just thinking, I don’t think she got the diva memo,” he said. “She didn’t get the spoiled musician. She doesn’t know how to pull that off. And that really, to me, said a whole lot.”  Donna Kelce and Ed Kelce have been married for over 20 years. Here's what to know about some of the most iconic parents in football.  While appearing on a  , ""New Heights,"" Feb. 6 prior to the 2023 Super Bowl, Donna Kelce, nee Blalock, said that she grew up in inner city Cleveland in a ""small house"" with her grandparents living upstairs.  After moving to the suburbs in fourth grade, the mom of two said own mother was ""very ill"" and passed away when she was 12 and her brother was 10. Following her biological mother's death, Donna Kelce said her dad married a ""wonderful human being"" named Mary.  ""(Mary) raised Don and I,"" Donna Kelce said, referring to her brother. ""And, by the grace of God, if we didn't have her, I don't think we would have made it through.""

After earning a degree in broadcast communications from Ohio University, Donna Kelce became the first person in her family to graduate from college.

But Donna Kelce had another date she was supposed to be at while chatting the night away with Ed Kelce.  ""I was supposed to go out with a guy that night. We were supposed to go to a play and I never made it,"" she said. ""Your dad and I talked forever ... It was meant to be. It's just the way it was.""  Ed Kelce said that he didn't remember that his former wife stood up her date, nor that he used that pickup line.  But he did recall Donna Kelce giving him a ride home to shower and change after his day in the Steel Mill. He said they then continued their conversation at another nearby bar called ""The No Name.""  Donna and Ed Kelce open up about the end of their marriage in the documentary ""Kelce,"" focusing on their older son. While the couple say they would have ""preferred"" to have split early on, they stayed together for the kids. “If we had split as we probably both would have preferred, that would have been a nightmare with the logistics, getting kids where they had to be and providing all the support,” Ed Kelce said in ""Kelce"". They remained amicable. On the ""New Heights"" podcast, Donna Kelce said they're ""friends to this day."" She continued, “We get along great, it’s just sometimes people move apart.”  Ed Kelce shared a similar sentiment, telling the two that he wants “nothing but happiness for (their) mother.”  After Jason Kelce asked each of his parents separately if they regret marrying one another, they both quickly responded no, with Donna Kelce adding, “Because I got you two.”  Donna Kelce said she and her former husband were a “tag team” raising their two boys and “did all these fun things.”  “It was perfect,” she said. “You got to do whatever sports you wanted. You got to go on all the tournaments. You got to everything and it worked out.”  After asking their dad to recount which organized sport first inspired their passion for the game, Ed Kelce reminded them that their love began on their living room floor.  ""The first thing you did was you were a toddler on the living room floor and you rolled a ball to me, you rolled it back and we played that way and that’s where it all started,"" he said on the ""New Heights"" podcast.  Growing up in Cleveland Heights, Ed Kelce coached both his sons in baseball, both tee-ball and coach pitch baseball. He even built them areas to play sports in their garage and threw a ball around with his two boys in their front yard.  Though he beamed talking about his sons' athletic abilities from a young age, Ed Kelce said he always reminded his sons the value of hard work and humility — both as a coach and as a dad.  ""I didn’t like you being on the team where you were the stud,"" he said to Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce. ""I wanted you on a team where you had to work harder.""  In 2019, Donna Kelce and Ed Kelce became grandparents when  , welcomed daughter Wyatt. The couple has since welcomed two more girls, Elliotte and Bennett.  As of 2020, Ed Kelce lives a mile away from his first born son's family, moving from Cleveland to Philadelphia on a nine-acre farm, according to the  .  He told the publication that the move allows him more time with his granddaughters and the opportunity to help the family grow produce, the majority of which they donate to underprivileged families.  Donna Kelce shared a  s on Instagram in July from a summer trip to Disney World, set to the song ""Moments We Live For.""  While in high school, Donna Kelce revealed on the podcast that she secretly ran track and field since her dad didn’t approve of her playing sports as a girl.  However, her stepmom encouraged her to get involved in athletics, where she went on to win “several medals” at the Junior Olympics in running and high jump, she told her sons on their podcast.  Donna Kelce added that her brother, Don Blalock, played football at Purdue University, as well.  Though he was heavily involved in his sons’ sports growing up, Ed Kelce said on that same podcast episode that the two inherited their “athletic ability probably from (their) mother.” Seemingly to both Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce's surprise, their dad revealed on ""New Heights"" that he sees parts of himself in both of his sons.  As they seemed to expect, Ed Kelce said he notices ""mannerisms, tones, speech things, the way we talk and address people"" that are similar to Jason Kelce.  ""But as far as do I see more of myself in Jason than you?"" he directed to Travis Kelce. ""No, and in some ways it might be the other way.""  When pressed by both sons on what traits Travis Kelce resembles of his father, Ed Kelce declined to comment further, letting out a laugh.  When initially being asked by her two sons on the podcast about kids, Donna Kelce revealed that they were trying to have children about five years after getting married, ""but it wasn't working for whatever reason.""   But one day, she said she went in to her doctor's office and was told, ""‘You’re going to have a little one,’ and I went, ‘Whoa.’""  After Travis Kelce gave his brother a hard time for ""being a mistake,"" Jason Kelce fired back that their mom needed to admit that she wanted her second child to be a girl.  ""I was hoping for a girl, but I got one! He's a fashionista and a dancer!"" she joked of Travis Kelce.  Donna Kelce also revealed that she told the boys' father that she chose the name Travis after a character in the movie ""Overboard,"" when really she was picturing a daytime soap opera character.  ""I just thought he was the most gorgeous man in the world, and I named you after him!"" she said to her second-born son.  Both football legends asked their dad on the podcast to   since they found out when Jason Kelce was 27 and Travis Kelce was 25 that they'd been saying it wrong their whole lives.  Ed Kelce explained that their last name should actually be just one syllable, but most people he encountered pronounced it with two.  ""I got tired of correcting people,"" he said as his sons laughed.  When they asked their dad which pronunciation they should technically be using nowadays, he responded, ""Do whatever you want, I did.""  Both the Kelce parents agreed that their sons seemed gifted from a young age, but that didn't necessarily put pro sports at the forefront of their minds.  When it came time for her sons to be drafted after both playing football at the University of Cincinnati, Donna Kelce said she only feared if the country would see Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce how she saw them.  ""I knew you two would be able to,"" she told her sons. ""But you just don’t know how your children are going to relate nationally. You know that they might be the best kid in your city. They might be the most talented or athletic kid on the college team, but you don’t know how that is across the country.""  As for advice to up and coming NFL moms, Donna Kelce has two tidbits. For one, she advises all parents to tell their children that ""no matter what anyone says, always believe in yourself.""  ""No. 2, keep at it,"" she continued. ""Go up to teachers. Not the parent — the child has to do this. 'What do I have to do to get more playing time? What do I need to work on?' The parent cannot do it. They cannot be the ones that are on the coach’s backs all the time. It’s got to come from the kid.""  Ed Kelce made a point on his sons’ podcast that parents who want to raise kids who one day are competing at professional level, should “feed a passion for athletics, not the NFL.”  As for this past Super Bowl, both parents wouldn't say on the podcast which team they were rooting for. When Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce asked their dad, he responded with, ""Kelce!""  ""I’m going to be screaming the entire game, whoever has the ball,"" Donna Kelce said. ""I want it to be the highest scoring game, Super Bowl, ever, in the history of Super Bowls.""  Donna Kelce reminded them that the February sibling rivalry would be far more lighthearted than when they each were in their first respective Super Bowls.   ""This one is just going to be pure joy, pure fun — you're both in there!"" she said. ""How can it get any better than this? It's going to be the best day ever.""  The Chiefs beat the Eagles 38-35 on Feb. 12, but Donna Kelce repped both teams for the entire matchup.  Before and after the big win (or big loss), the mother-sons trio has been pictured all over sports media, most recently in commercials for    Amid romance rumors with Travis Kelce,   on Sept. 24 and was spotted next to Donna Kelce in Arrowhead Stadium club seats. Fans on   seemed to be having fun together, with the ""Karma"" singer grabbing the NFL mom's arm as they let out nonstop giggles.  During the Oct. 12   at Arrowhead Stadium, Swift and Donna Kelce shared another sweet moment when the singer whispered something in her ear. Mama Kelce then flashed a big smile on her face.  While attending the same Kansas City game, Swift was seen standing next to Ed Kelce watching the game from their box seats.  At one moment, Swift was   with Ed Kelce. During the brother’s “New Heights” podcast episode the following week, they   about the interaction.  “This is a terrifying conversation,” Travis Kelce said in reaction to Swift talking to his dad mid-game. “I felt terrible. I felt terrible for Taylor.” Jason Kelce added, “If you hear Dad talking to anybody and you can’t hear what’s happening, who knows where that conversation’s going.” The Chiefs tight end made sure to give his pops some credit though, saying the two have the “best f--- dad in the world.”  While looking at a photo of the pop star and NFL dad chatting and inquiring about what they could have been talking about, Travis Kelce said his dad was “just absolutely pumping her up,” adding, “He started listening to her music a little more. He started doing some stuff.” Jason Kelce joked, “He’s probably saying, ‘I’ve taken all of your CDs out at the local library and I burned them into my computer, because that is legal as a taxpaying citizen.’” While appearing on TODAY on Oct. 6,   since her interaction with Swift at the the Kansas City Chiefs home game on Sept. 24 went viral.  “It truly feels like I’m in some kind of an alternate universe,” Kelce said. “It’s just really, really strange, but it’s fun. It’s a great ride.” Though TODAY co-anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb asked about Travis Kelce's rumored relationship with Swift, Donna Kelce remained tight-lipped.  “I honestly can’t tell you,"" she responded. ""It’s just too new.” However, Mama Kelce did reveal to   the kind of person she hopes her son will end up with.  “I want to see that smile on his face, the brightness, the sparkle in his eyes, like Jason has,” she said at the time, referring to  . “That’s what I want to see, and I hope I’ll see that some day.” Becca Wood is a news and trending reporter for TODAY Digital based in New York City.

https://www.today.com/popculture/jason-momoa-roman-empire-snl-rcna125887,Jason Momoa can’t stop thinking about the Roman Empire in hilarious ‘SNL’ sketch,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The Roman Empire remains top-of-mind for men across the world, including those on “Saturday Night Live.” Jason Momoa   for the second time on Saturday, Nov. 18 alongside   The episode featured a digital short that talked about mens’ favorite internet topic of 2023 —    Back in September, posts that contained the hashtag #romanempire garnered millions of views across TikTok, with women asking the men in their life how often they thought of the Roman Empire. Spoiler alert: a lot, apparently. Even travel writer and television personality Rick Steves told TODAY.com in October that  , though that was more likely due to his job than anything else. In the  , Jason Momoa, Mikey Day, and Kenan Thompson’s partners Ego Nwodim, Chloe Troast, and Punkie Johnson all question what is on their minds.  Nwodim gets more than she bargains for when she inquires about Momoa’s feelings and he reveals that it was the Roman Empire and not their relationship. “I’m just thinking about the Roman Empire, Ancient Rome, five times a day it pops into my dome, which reminds me, they invented the dome,” he raps in full ancient gladiator garb. “It’s one of the reasons that I think about Rome. Caesar, straight didn’t give a f---, drank ice cold water from an aqueduct.” In a hard transition from the Roman Empire rap to Troast delicately singing about her newborn baby, Troast starts to assume that her partner, Day, is tearing up thinking about their child. He was not.  “Rome, Rome, bring a tear to my eye in the year MMXXIII,” Day raps, before spitting off random facts about Rome. “Did you know that their statues weren’t white? They painted them in colors bold and bright!” Johnson barely got a chance to reflect on the financial struggles in her relationship with Thompson before the sketch cut to a clip of the comedian rapping about the Roman Empire.  “Gladiators would rarely ever die, it’s not like the movies, they mostly stayed alive,” Thompson says. “They built roads so good, they’re still in use today.” To snap Momoa out of his Roman Empire trance, Nwodim smacks him across the face twice and begins to scold him for constantly thinking about the ancient empire, which she says is rubbing off on their son. As it turns out, their son's personal fixation isn’t the Roman Empire, but rather, dinosaurs. When Momoa falls back into his trance, Nwodim smacks him once again, telling him he needs to “be thinking about things that matter today.”  And what’s that, one may ask? Astrology.  At the end of the sketch, Momoa makes the mistake of pointing out that the Romans were also interested in astrology, which earns him another smack from Nwodim across the face.

https://www.today.com/news/news/disney-apple-x-elon-musk-antisemitic-post-rcna125857,"Disney, Apple among advertisers to pull business on X after Elon Musk’s antisemitic post","Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Tech billionaire Elon Musk faced a third day of backlash Friday from Jewish leaders,   and media advertisers including Disney and Apple after he embraced an antisemitic conspiracy theory earlier in the week, the latest in a pattern of his echoing anti-Jewish bigotry going back years.  Musk sparked the criticism with six words he posted Wednesday afternoon on X, the social media app he purchased a year ago. Responding to another user who had accused Jews of hating white people and who had expressed indifference to antisemitism, Musk wrote: “You have said the actual truth.”  Musk, the CEO of the automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, followed up his first tweet with criticism of the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, an organization founded by Jews to oppose antisemitism.   for months over its efforts to reduce extremism on social media, a campaign that Musk says has cost X ad sales.  On Thursday morning, Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s CEO, said Musk was acting dangerously.  “At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one’s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories,” he  , with a screenshot of Musk’s six-word tweet.  The White House   as the backlash continued, saying that Musk had promoted “antisemitic and racist hate” against “our core values as Americans.” Accounts with histories of espousing anti-Jewish views celebrated Musk’s tweet as welcome news and as confirmation that he agrees with them “on the JQ,” short for “Jewish question,” a term   for decades.  “This is old-timey antisemitism with new lingo,” said A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism who studies right-wing movements and media at the University of Alabama. Musk announced a content policy Friday that the ADL welcomed, saying that X would suspend accounts that use the phrase “from the river to the sea.” The phrase is popular among many Palestinians, while many Jews say the phrase means  . But otherwise, Musk was defiant about his comments earlier in the week. His tweets from Wednesday were still online, and Friday, he posted on X that free speech was at stake and that he would not be pressured. “I am sticking to my principles!” he replied to one user.  “As for any fake advocacy groups who seek to suppress free speech, they should remember that karma is real,” he added.  A representative for X did not immediately respond to an interview request Friday.  IBM said Thursday it had pulled its advertisements from X. A recent investigation by the progressive organization Media Matters found that   were running on X adjacent to pro-Nazi material.  “IBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,” the company said in a statement. A representative for IBM added that the company was investigating the Media Matters report, not Musk’s posts specifically.  The Walt Disney Company is also pausing spending on X, according to a source with direct knowledge. Its decision was earlier   by The New York Times. Two other media companies, Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery, said through representatives late Friday that they were pausing, too. Comcast and NBCUniversal are also holding off on advertising on the X platform, a spokesperson said Friday. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, which is the parent company of NBC News.) Apple is also holding off on advertising on X, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The European Commission decided to   over concerns about disinformation, Politico reported Friday. A commission spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, said on the platform Thursday that antisemitism and discrimination are unacceptable, though she did not directly address Musk’s tweets or IBM’s move. “When it comes to this platform — X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There’s no place for it anywhere in the world — it’s ugly and wrong. Full stop,”  . X also said in an email that Media Matters’ investigation was flawed, in part because ads are designed to follow people as they browse the site, so the researcher saw the same ads multiple times in ways others might not.  Musk defended his past tweets in  , saying he is a “prosemite,” not an antisemite.   Musk’s latest comments came at a fraught time for Jews worldwide and in Israel. Reports of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. climbed 388% in the aftermath of Hamas’ terrorist attacks last month compared to the same period last year, according to the ADL. This week, the Biden administration   to reduce antisemitism and Islamophobia.  Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the director of global social action for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization named for the famed Nazi hunter, said he was baffled by the way Musk uses X.  “I don’t understand why Elon Musk, even though it’s his toy, would jump in with this kind of statement, whatever his motivation may be, that further involves him with bigots,” he said.  “I almost feel like saying to him, ‘Grow up,’” he added.  Experts who study antisemitism and other extremism said Musk was parroting decades-old baseless claims about Jews’ colluding with one another at the expense of others.  “Not only is there no evidence; these have been discredited time and time again,” said Matthew Hughey, a sociology professor at the University of Connecticut who has studied white supremacy.  Musk has 163 million followers on X, more than anyone else, so what he publishes can have a real impact on the real-world actions of others, Hughey added.  “We should expect to see more hate crimes and rallying around this type of discourse because of his amplification,” he said.  Musk’s tweet was the third post in a thread involving other people. The initial post, by a self-described Jewish conservative from South Florida, was a video condemning antisemitism online. It said: “You got something you want to say? Why dont you say it to our faces.” The second person then jumped in with a multi-paragraph outline of a conspiracy theory sometimes known as the “ ,” which has been amplified by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, among others. This person said that Jewish communities have been pushing “hatred against whites” and that Jews support “flooding” the U.S. with “hordes of minorities.”  The person wrote that he was “deeply disinterested” in “western Jewish populations” who are now facing threats, to which Musk responded, “You have said the actual truth.”  By Friday, Musk’s tweet had received 6.7 million views on X, according to the site’s view counter.  Musk has a long history of amplifying antisemitic conspiracy theories. In 2018,  : “Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello”; in a   in response to accusations of antisemitism at the time, he said he was referring only to “powerful people.” Last year, he tweeted a photo of Adolf Hitler as   and  , formerly known as Kanye West, to social media despite Ye’s antisemitic comments.  “Elon Musk has been making antisemitic comments on Twitter and on other formats for many, many years,” said Bauer, of the University of Alabama.  “When someone tells you who they are, you should listen, and he’s long been telling us that he’s an antisemite,” he said.

https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/gwyneth-paltrow-kids-rcna77167,Gwyneth Paltrow explains why she 'stepped away' from acting after daughter Apple was born,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Gwyneth Paltrow is sharing why she decided to take a break from acting after welcoming her first child, daughter Apple Martin, 19 years ago.  The Academy Award-winning actor has spoken frequently over the years about why she rarely takes acting roles, and now she's opening up about the exact moment she started to devote less time to her acting career.  In 2004, Paltrow and her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, became parents for the first time when Apple Martin was born. The former couple's son, Moses Martin, arrived in 2006.  The 51-year-old Goop founder spoke to   about her children in a recent interview and revealed that motherhood is one of the reasons why she has taken a step back from the big screen.  When speaking about her   over the last decade, Paltrow said, ""Well, it’s kind of ironic because I really stepped away from acting when Apple was born. The last time I was in every scene of a movie was when I was pregnant with her."" She said she started to think about the lengthy filming schedule that some movies require and knew she couldn't spend that much time away from her children.  ""When I had (Apple), it just, everything felt redefined for me, and I thought, ‘I’m not sure that I want to do this so much as a career. I definitely don’t want to...I’m not going to go away for months on end,'"" she said.  The ""Shakespeare in Love"" star told   that she preferred being away from the spotlight and at home with her children.  ""I feel very blessed that I’ve been able to try to pursue this other career and kind of like keep hours where I’m able to be home and make them dinner and stuff like that,"" she shared at the time.  In addition to her two children with Chris Martin, Paltrow is also a stepmother to husband Brad Falchuk's two children: Isabella and Brody Falchuk. During an Instagram Q&A August 30, the businesswoman said she cares for her stepchildren as if they are her kids.  “You know, there’s no book on this; nobody tells us what to do. And in fact, all of the existing media around what a stepmother is casts us in this evil, villainous light,"" she said, according to  .  She added, ""But for myself, the minute I decided, and fully embodied the idea that my step kids were my kids and I love them just as much and I gave them the same rules and boundaries, and just kind of whole-heartedly went for it, then the easier the whole thing got. And now it’s pretty great.""  Read on to learn more about Paltrow’s children. In 2004, Paltrow welcomed her daughter, Apple, with Martin.  In an   at the time, Paltrow revealed why she named her daughter Apple.  ""When we were first pregnant, her daddy said, ‘If it’s a girl I think her name should be Apple.' It sounded so sweet, and it conjured such a lovely picture for me, you know,"" Paltrow said. ""Apples are so sweet and they’re wholesome, and it’s biblical. And I just thought it sounded so lovely."" Paltrow noted that Martin was ""so in love"" with Apple after she arrived. They immediately noticed that their daughter was a ""very tranquil"" and ""aware"" baby.

https://www.today.com/news/news/spacexs-starship-liftoff-mishap-rcna125856,SpaceX’s Starship achieves liftoff and separation but ‘mishap’ results in loss of rocket,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands SpaceX launched the most powerful rocket ever developed — the company’s next-generation Starship — on a key test flight on Saturday that could pave the way for missions to the moon and eventually Mars. The uncrewed test flight was mostly successful with several key milestones achieved, but SpaceX ultimately lost contact with Starship roughly 10 minutes into flight, and the spacecraft likely self-detonated due to an issue mid-flight. In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said a “mishap” occurred during the rocket’s launch. “The anomaly resulted in a loss of the vehicle. No injuries or public property damage have been reported,” the administration said. The FAA will investigate the mishap and ultimately determine if the rocket’s return to flight would affect public safety. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship rocket lifted off at 8 a.m. ET from SpaceX’s Starbase test site in Boca Chica, Texas.  Cheers erupted from SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, as the Starship rocket ignited and rumbled skyward. The fate of the Starship spacecraft is not yet known, but   that SpaceX webcaster John Insprucker said during a livestream of the event that the spacecraft’s automated flight termination system was likely triggered and the spacecraft appeared to have detonated. It’s not yet known what could have caused SpaceX to lose contact with Starship, but the spacecraft’s flight termination system is designed to kick in if it veers off course or another major anomaly is detected. This was only the second launch of Starship, after a first test in April ended with the rocket exploding several minutes after liftoff. The rocket has two parts: a first-stage booster known as Super Heavy and an upper-stage Starship spacecraft. During Saturday’s launch, the two parts of the rocket separated in flight for the first time — a major milestone for SpaceX. The company pulled off a maneuver dubbed “hot staging,” which involved igniting the Starship spacecraft’s engines while the Super Heavy booster was still partially firing. The hot-staging strategy is designed to use the spacecraft’s engines to help it separate and continue on to orbit. After separation, the Super Heavy first-stage was meant to fall back to Earth and splash down in the Gulf of Mexico, but SpaceX reported that the booster exploded, possibly due to an anomaly. Few other details were provided at the time. Both the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship spacecraft are designed to be reusable. The launch was a closely watched event, with high stakes for SpaceX as well as for the future of American space exploration.  Starship is expected to play a crucial part in NASA’s efforts to return to the moon. The spacecraft was selected by the agency to carry astronauts to the lunar surface during the upcoming Artemis III mission, which could launch as early as 2025. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has also said that Starship was developed for future missions to Mars. The rocket’s second outing followed what was a fiery and destructive debut earlier this year. In SpaceX’s first attempt to launch Starship, the rocket exploded a few minutes after liftoff, destroying much of the infrastructure at the launch pad and causing damage to coastal wetlands and a nearby Texas state park. The incident triggered a monthslong safety review and drew intense scrutiny over the environmental consequences of launching rockets from Boca Chica. Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared SpaceX to proceed with Starship’s second launch, saying that the company has conformed to the environmental protection requirements for such operations.   © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

She added, “I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.” The fan was later identified as Ana Clara Benevides Machado by the event organizer, Time4Fun.  “Last night, Ana Clara felt unwell and was promptly attended to by the team of firefighters and paramedics, being taken to the medical center at the Nilton Santos Stadium for first aid protocol,” the organizer told NBC News in a statement. “Given the situation, the medical team chose to transfer her to Salgado Filho Hospital, where, after almost an hour of emergency care, she unfortunately died.” According to  , she remains set to perform in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, Nov. 19. This is the second concert Swift has had to postpone on the South American leg of her “Eras Tour.” The “Karma” singer's Nov. 10 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina was postponed to Nov. 12 due to weather.  Swift announced the news   at the time, writing in part, “I love a rain show but I’m never going to endanger my fans or my fellow performers and crew.”  “We’ve rescheduled tonight’s Buenos Aires show for Sunday due to the weather being so truly chaotic it would be unsafe to try and put on this concert,” she added.

Nineteen years after the actor tried to make “fetch happen,” she  , including Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Seyfried for a nostalgic ad and mini-sequel. Chabert tells TODAY.com that reprising her role as Gretchen Wieners and being back with a number of her former castmates was a “full circle moment” — and would even consider doing a real “Mean Girls” sequel.  “Oh my gosh, it was the best! It was like stepping back in time, like no time had passed,” the actor says while talking about her Glade partnership. “It was so fun to reminisce about all the memories we have from the movie and then catch up with each other.” “We’re all moms now,” she adds, “And it was such a full circle moment and I’m so thankful for the experience.” The commercial, filmed for Walmart’s Black Friday deals, featured three-fourths of the Plastics, as well as other original characters, as adult versions of their characters with teenagers of their own. Lohan, who portrayed Cady Heron, appears to be the school’s guidance counselor, Gretchen is a stage mom, and Karen Smith (Seyfried) is a weather reporter. There’s also a nod to the famous “Jingle Bell Rock” performance.  When asked if the commercial’s storyline sparked interest in furthering the “Mean Girls” franchise, Chabert was all in.  “Oh, I think we all really enjoyed revisiting those characters and would, of course, be open to it,” she says. “But for now, I’m just thankful we had that experience.” The comedy, meanwhile, is getting the movie musical treatment.

Chabert spoke with TODAY.com as part of her partnership with Glade for their limited-edition holiday collection. “This is my absolute favorite time of year and creating a festive vibe in my home, and the feeling of the holidays, is so special,” she says, sharing that her favorite scent from the collection is the Starlight & Snowflakes. However, the Twinkling Pine & Cedar fragrance is great for those who have artificial Christmas trees like she does. One thing she loves to do, Chabert shares, is “creating the ambiance of the holidays.” The actor, these days known for her Hallmark Christmas movies, has been in the holiday spirit since Halloween ended. She says she immediately brought out the garland, lights and Christmas tree and had her 7-year-old daughter, Julia, help her.   “We had Christmas music going and we had Glade candles burning,"" she shares. “I love this time of year so much because, not only do I like to make movies about this time of year but, it brings back my most cherished childhood memories. And then I get to create these new memories with my daughter. It’s such a blessing to see the magic of the holidays through her eyes.” One thing her daughter gets extra excitement about during this time of year are her holiday movies, she says.

Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, and Combs  . In the lawsuit, filed in New York, she alleges that he frequently beat her, forced her to engage in sex acts — that he referred to as “freak offs” and sometimes recorded — with male prostitutes and, that on one occasion, as she was trying to end their relationship in 2018, he forced his way into her home and raped her. Aubrey O’Day, who was discovered by Combs on the reality TV show “Making the Band 3,” and launched to fame as a member of the urban pop group Danity Kane, expressed her “full support of Cassie,” in a statement Thursday. “It isn’t easy to take on one of the most powerful people in this industry,” she said. “May her voice bring all the others to the table, so we can start having more transparent conversations about what is actually happening behind the scenes.” Asked specifically by NBC News whether she had witnessed Combs abuse anyone or been abused by him, O’Day said: “I need to take a moment before I speak about it further. There are layers.” On Thursday, Dawn Richard, another former member of Danity Kane,  on the social media platform X that she was “praying for Cassie and her family, for peace and healing” and that Ventura is “beautiful and brave.” Wanita “D. Woods” Woodgett, also of Danity Kane fame, shared a statement of support on her  and   accounts. “I haven’t posted anything on this platform for a very long time, but today ... there is a very good reason to,” she   on X early Friday, adding that Ventura is “incredibly brave to shine light” on what she “endured in the dark.” Woodgett also said: “Im sorry you had to go through it alone. Im praying for your continued strength and I offer my full support to you.” None of the posts expressed personal knowledge about the specific accusations against Combs. It is not clear how well O’Day, Richard and Woodgett know Ventura, 37. Richard and Woodgett did not immediately return requests for an interview Friday. Combs  Woodgett and O’Day from Danity Kane in 2008 on national television. At the time, he said O’Day needed to “humble” herself and that he believed Woods had gotten “caught up in the wrath” of O’Day. “I got love for Aubrey. I don’t have any beef with her,” he said then. “I just want to work with the young lady that I signed, not the person that fame has made her.” In the lawsuit, Ventura alleges that Combs brought her into his “ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle” not long after she met him and signed her to his Bad Boy label in 2005, when she was 19 and he was 37. The suit, which describes Combs as a “vicious, cruel and controlling man” who lured Ventura into a romantic relationship and “almost immediately assert[ed] possession and control over her,” also alleges he plied her with drugs. The suit includes a trigger warning for “highly graphic information of a sexual nature, including sexual assault.” It alleges he forced her to have sex with male prostitutes while he masturbated and filmed them. Attorney Ben Brafman said Combs “vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations.” “For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura’s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail,” Brafman said in a statement. “Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’s reputation and seeking a payday.” In response, Douglas Wigdor, Ventura’s attorney, indicated both sides had spoken before the suit was filed. “Mr. Combs offered Ms. Ventura eight figures to silence her and prevent the filing of this lawsuit,” he said. “She rejected his efforts.” Combs, 54, has gone by such names as Puff Daddy, Puffy, Diddy and Love. He founded Bad Boy in the early 1990s and produced “Making the Band” for MTV. He is regarded as a trailblazer of hip-hop, fashion and media, having created the Sean John clothing line and launching the Revolt TV channel. Combs’ net worth has been estimated at $1 billion. O’Day would challenge him on the “Making the Band” reality series and has been openly critical of him for years. During an   of the “Only Stans” podcast, she said, “as I’ve gotten older, I’ve let go of a lot of the trauma and I’ve learned to really appreciate some of the more personal beautiful moments I’ve had with him,” referring to Combs. She also said that she was being offered “a few hundred dollars” to sign away her rights to ever disclose what she experienced as a member of Danity Kane and “to stay hushed” on Combs. As part of the deal, she said, she would be required to release Combs “for any claims or wrongdoings or actions prior to the date of the release” and sign a nondisclosure agreement that states she would never publicly disparage him, his mother, Janice Combs; his son, Justin Combs; Bad Boy; EMI or Sony. Representatives for Combs did not provide NBC News with a comment for this article. “I just wish that Puff would do what he’s saying he’s doing. I wish he would pay us what we deserved for all the work that we did. And I wish he would make right his wrongs,” O’Day said in September after Combs announced that he would give publishing rights back to Bad Boy artists. “At the end of the day, I urge everyone to think about the headline versus the truth and really what this seems to be is a way to shut a lot of people up. And what would be the motivation to do that?” “I think we’re going to learn soon enough what it is,” she added. Janelle Griffith is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

Cassie, whose full name is Cassie Ventura, who was just 19 when she met the music mogul,   Nov. 16 in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleging that Combs raped and abused her during their time together. The “Me & U” singer, 37, claimed in her lawsuit that Combs, then in his late 30s, pursued her as a up-and-coming singer signed to his music label, Bad Boy Records. The lawsuit said Combs was prone to “uncontrollable rage,” and beat and kicked Ventura, sometimes in front of the staff and employees of Bad Boy Entertainment. Ventura, who married personal trainer Alex Fine in 2019, claimed that Combs raped her and forced her to participate in “intricately staged and forced sexual encounters” with male sex workers while he masturbated and filmed the encounters. She claimed Combs was able to control her after introducing her to “a drug-fueled lifestyle that kept her complacent and compliant.” Combs' attorney, Ben Brafman, responded to the lawsuit, telling NBC News in a statement that Combs ""vehemently denies"" Ventura's allegations, calling them ""baseless and outrageous lies."" He also said Ventura had demanded $30 million from Combs by threatening to write a damaging book about their relationship. Read on to see a timeline of Combs and Ventura's relationship. According to her civil suit, Combs met Ventura in 2005 when she was 19, one year before the singer’s self-titled debut album was released on Combs' label, Bad Boy Records. In 2007, rumors surfaced about Combs and Ventura, who were frequently photographed together at events, around the same time Combs ended his on-again, off-again relationship with Kim Porter, the mother of four of his children who  . The never-married   has also welcomed children with exes Misa Hylton-Brim and Sarah Chapman and model Dana Tran. The pair appeared to confirm that they were dating when they sat side by side at Kanye West’s Paris Fashion Week show in March 2012. The couple continued to be photographed at more star-studded events, including the GQ Men of the Year Party at Chateau Marmont on Nov. 13, 2012 in Los Angeles.  In August 2012, engagement rumors were sparked when Ventura posted a since-deleted photo on Instagram that showed her left hand sporting what looked like a gigantic diamond engagement ring,   at the time. A rep for Combs followed up to tell E! News that the couple were not engaged. Less than two years later, Combs fueled engagement rumors again when he posted a since-deleted Instagram photo of a huge diamond ring on Valentine's Day 2014,   at the time. “Baby do you like it? I just want to get you wat you Like ! I just wanna Mk you smile :) #takeDat. !,” Combs captioned the photo. Once again, Combs' rep later told E! News that the couple were not engaged.  ""exclusively"" reported in August 2016 that Combs and Ventura had ""not split"" despite media reports saying they parted ways following an allegedly heated argument in Beverly Hills. Combs hinted that he wanted to have children with Ventura during a January 2018 interview with the hosts of  “I’m trying to get to 10 (kids). It’s a race,” said Combs, adding, ""I could go to eight without a problem. I could go to eight real quick."" When one of the hosts asked Combs if he would welcome more children with his ""current woman,"" Combs replied, “Whatever's supposed to happen in the future is going to happen, but that’s something that I want.” The Grammy winner then clarified, “I would only have (more children) with my girl, of course.” In October 2018, Ventura's rep confirmed to the   website that she and Combs broke up. “They are indeed no longer together and haven’t been for months,” the statement read. Ventura found new love with personal trainer Alex Fine in early 2019. In June 2019, when the singer announced   that she and Fine were expecting their first child, Combs responded by posting a since-deleted photo of the couple to wish them well, Billboard reported. “Congratulations @Cassie and Alex,” Diddy captioned the pic at the time. “I wish you all nothing but love and happiness. God bless  L O V E.” Ventura and Fine welcomed their first child, a daughter named Frankie, in December 2019. Their second daughter, Sunny, was born in March 2021,  . Ventura   alleging that Combs raped and abused her on Nov. 16. She filed the suit through the  , a New York law that allows people who say they were victims of sexual abuse to file civil suits after the statute of limitations has expired. Combs' attorney, Ben Brafman, told NBC News in a statement that Combs denied Ventura's allegations, calling them “baseless and outrageous lies."" He also said Ventura had demanded $30 million from Combs in order to stop her from writing a “threatening” book about their relationship. Ventura’s lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, sent NBC News the following response to Brafman’s comments: Mr. Comb’s offered Ms. Ventura eight figures to silence her and prevent the filing of this lawsuit. She rejected his efforts and decided to give a voice to all woman who suffer in silence. Ms. Ventura should be applauded for her bravery.” Gina Vivinetto is a writer for TODAY.com. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/news/sports/mclaren-f1-lando-norris-female-viewers-rcna125455,McLaren F1 driver Lando Norris recognizes increased female interest in Formula One,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands McLaren Formula One driver Lando Norris is noticing a rising number of female viewers at Formula One races, a sport that consists of an all-male driver line-up and previously known to be a boys club on and off the track. The 24-year-old driver secured his seat on the McLaren team in 2019 at the age of 19. Now, in his fifth season on the team and the sport, Norris currently ranks fifth out of 20 in the 2023 F1 Drivers Championship, a title that has already been secured by Red Bull Racing driver and now three-time world champion  .  The 2023 Formula One season consists of a total of 23 races — or Grand Prix — all taking place in various countries and continents. It is made up of 20 drivers, two racing in each of the 10 teams, who commonly interact on and off the track. Following the   on Nov. 16, one last race is scheduled to conclude the season in Abu Dhabi on Nov. 26. The British driver has yet to win his first F1 race, but stood on seven podiums this season, and 13 podiums throughout his five-year-long career. In an  .com, the driver reflects on his career in the sport and shares his thoughts about the increased female viewership and interest in Formula One. “At times it feels like more girls than guys,” Norris says. In December 2022,   reported that females make up around 40% of F1 fans, an 8% increase from 2017. ""There's a huge amount of girls who are into it, and I think that's a good thing, not only for the sport as a whole to increase the variety of people that are watching, but also for girls to get into racing,"" he says. The last woman to race in Formula One was Italian driver Lella Lombardi from 1974–1976. Lombardo was the second woman to ever race in the sport and the only woman to ever score points. Italian driver Maria Teresa de Filippis was the first in 1958, racing for one year. Norris notes the importance of attracting female viewers as a way to keep the future of F1 alive. ""Girls and women and guys, whoever it is, if you can get more of them at a young age to come into racing and be interested at a young age, then you’re more likely to have a girl racing driver at some point, which I think would be amazing,"" he says.  One could say the increase in female viewership — and increase in fans in the U.S. — could be tied to Netflix’s docuseries “Formula 1: Drive to Survive.” The six-season series, which premiered in 2019, highlights the top moments throughout the F1 season, including a rundown of multiple races and behind the scenes footage of the drivers and teams. The series’ success resulted in a rise of the sport’s popularity in the U.S, according to  . In a 2022 survey by  , the poll showed 28% of U.S. adults as fans of the sport. Over half of the 28% claimed “Drive to Survive” was the reason behind their sparked interest. “Drive to Survive” links to a nationwide sparked interest in the sport. According to   data, “more than 360,000 viewers who didn’t view F1 in the latter part of the 2021 season, watched F1 racing in 2022 after first watching ‘Drive to Survive.’” As he began racing for McLaren in his late teens, Norris spent the majority of his early 20s focusing solely on the sport. “This has been my life since I was seven. I’ve been karting and racing and traveling the world,” Norris says. “I’ve also not experienced many other things outside of Formula One, and just outside of racing.” With just five years of experience in F1, Norris is already seeing the sport change. As he joined the sport at a young age, many of the current drivers also began racing in F1 in their late teens.  Younger drivers are making a significant impact in F1, with a new generation of drivers emerging and performing well against experienced drivers. Verstappen, now three-time world champion, first joined the sport at the age of 17. While some drivers are more experienced than others on the grid, Norris recognizes that the younger drivers have shown their potential when going up against more experienced drivers. ""With me going up against Daniel (Ricciardo) and George (Russell) going up against Lewis (Hamilton),"" he says. ""I think, George has proved he's a very, very capable driver and can beat Lewis on his day.""  Norris, along with Mercedes driver Russell (25) and Williams Racing's Alexander Albon (27) made their F1 debuts in 2019. “For George, Alex and myself to come in on the same year, it’s quite rare to have three new guys from Formula Two,” Norris  . “I think each one of them has proved to be an extremely good driver, and I think more teams are also willing to accept younger drivers.” The emergence of young drivers is also a result of the new technology that is used for racing practice, Norris says.  ""They’ve grew up doing more racing than what people used to do at times. They’ve also grown up with (driving) simulators,"" Norris says. ""Therefore, it isn't a coincidence, in many ways, that you're seeing a bit more of a (younger) group come into Formula One."" Norris celebrated his 24th birthday on Nov. 13.  “I’m scared,” he  . “I’m growing up.” To celebrate the occasion, luggage brand Tumi threw him a birthday party. Norris, who is a Tumi ambassador, contributed to the designs of the McLaren x Tumi collaboration.  “I’ve always been very much into kind of design and creativity and all of this stuff,"" Norris says about his collaboration. ""After meeting the guys and girls from Tumi, then we had a few talks and things lead on from there."" Tumi's McLaren Collection consists of a variety of travel luggage and backpacks. The collection's theme is based around McLaren Racing's iconic orange color, as the luggage colors majorly consist of black, gray and orange. ""We kind of try to mesh two worlds together in a way. At the same time, bring something back from my side and personal out of it, to then obviously give to everyone to be able to use when they travel,"" Norris says. As the 2023 season comes to a close this month, Norris will return to the sport next year with McLaren. In the meantime, he wants ""to travel and spend more with his friends.  The 2024 season, spanning from the end of February to the beginning of December, will consist of 24 races, the highest number of races to ever be scheduled in an F1 season. The first race of the season takes place in Bahrain. Dea is an editorial intern at TODAY.com and is frequently keeping up with pop culture news and emerging trends.

Emily Taylor was talking with another parent when she heard a comment that just didn't sit right with her.  ""A comment was made (arguing) that boys can't stay in the kitchen all day like girls can when helping with Thanksgiving stuff,"" Taylor told TODAY.com. ""This person has two adult sons. I was a little flabbergasted. Like: 'Yes they can, if you teach them to.'"" After continuing to think about the person's comment, Taylor sent a tweet urging parents to include their sons in Thanksgiving preparations.  ""As we approach Thanksgiving, I beg of you please involve your boys in the preparations as much as you involve your girls,"" the Louisiana single mom of two sons and a daughter said. ""Let them measure and mix and bake and create alongside their sisters. Have them set the table and pour drinks. Make them help clean up too."" ""It was just a thought I had in my head, and that's what Twitter is for I guess,"" Taylor said. ""I just think it's important that boys learn (domestic skills) early on. I've seen a lot of grown men who have that mindset — that they don't need to help with anything or the only thing they need to help with is the grilling or the smoking."" In a follow-up tweet, Taylor urged parents not to ""let another generation of boys grow up to be men who think the kitchen is the domain of women until it's time  ."" ""As a single mom, it's important for me to teach   of my kids to be self-sufficient, to participate in family life and to contribute to everything that's going on in our home,"" Taylor explained. Taylor says she taken aback by the reactions — both positive and negative — to her initial tweet.  ""In my online circles, it was a really inconsequential thing to say — most people I know wouldn't have any argument with it,"" Taylor said. ""But when I got outside of my 'normal circle'? Wow, people have some opinions."" Taylor explained that while her tweet resonated with a lot of people, including men who ""grew up in the kitchen and appreciated those moments with their moms or dads,"" others were quick to vehemently disagree.  ""A bunch of men were like: 'Nope, my job is to sit on the couch and watch football,'"" she added.  According to one  , an internet-based British international market research and data analytics firm, 48% of women surveyed said they do ""all or most"" of the cooking on Thanksgiving, and 21% of women said they ""do all of the Thanksgiving dinner clean-up."" ""I was pretty shocked that that was still such a prevalent response,"" Taylor said of the negative responses to her tweet. ""That was around 40% of the comments, though I don't think that's the attitude of 40% of men in the world. But yeah, it was surprising to see that many comments like that. I got one particular message that was pretty hateful."" Last year, Taylor said her sons would absolutely be in the kitchen, prepping their portion of the Thanksgiving meal.  ""My job is the green bean casserole and pumpkin pie,"" Taylor said. ""So we'll be making green bean casserole and pumpkin pies to take to Thanksgiving."" As for her now-viral tweet, Taylor said she hopes parents are ""more thoughtful and intentional"" about what they're teaching their kids.

Swift had a trio of shows planned from Nov. 9 to Nov. 11, however, her Nov. 10 show   due to adverse weather. The evening of the postponed show, Kelce and Swift were spotted leaving the restaurant Elena at the Four Seasons in Buenos Aires. Travis Kelce opened up about his night out with Swift to his brother, Jason Kelce, on the Nov. 15 episode of their podcast,  “It was the first night I was there. Really the only night we had a chance to go to dinner was the night the show got postponed,” he explained. “So we didn’t want to just go and have a blast throughout the city like we didn’t care about the show, so we made sure we stayed in the hotel and kind of kept to ourselves.”  The   did get a chance to have dinner together, with Travis Kelce telling his brother about their meal that evening.  “We got some good food, man,” he said. “Had some empanadas and steak.

https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/new-covid-variant-hv1-symptoms-rcna124198,"A new COVID variant, HV.1, is now dominant. These are its most common symptoms","Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands A new COVID-19 variant called HV.1 has become the dominant strain in the United States and now accounts for nearly one-third of cases nationwide. The highly infectious omicron subvariant has been circulating in the U.S. since the summer. In October, HV.1 rapidly gained speed and overtook other variants, including  , to become the most prevalent strain, according to  . During a two-week period ending on Nov. 11, HV.1 accounted for 29% of new COVID-19 infections in the U.S., per the CDC. After HV.1, the next most common variant was EG.5, which made up about 22% of cases, followed by FL.1.5.1 or “Fornax,” and XBB.1.16 or   Unlike its predecessors, HV.1 has yet to gain a catchy nickname. All of the COVID-19 variants that have become dominant in the U.S. over the last year are  , which began circulating in November 2021.  The emergence of HV.1 demonstrates how the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is able to mutate and give rise to new, highly contagious variants. HV.1's reign comes as the U.S. enters the thick of respiratory virus season and health officials roll out  . While the new booster still offers protection against newer variants, very few Americans have gotten the shot so far, TODAY.com previously reported. Right now, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations seem to be trending downward following  , per CDC data. However, infections are expected to increase again this winter as was the case the past three winter seasons, Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, tells TODAY.com.  As HV.1 continues to spread, many are curious if the new variant is more contagious or severe than previous strains, whether it's causing different symptoms, and when they should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Here’s what we know about HV.1 so far. HV.1 is part of the omicron family. “You can almost think of HV.1 as a grandchild of omicron,” says Schaffner. HV.1 is a sublineage of omicron XBB.1.9.2 and a direct descendent of EG.5, according to the  . “The COVID family of viruses likes to mutate. We’ve all learned that by now,"" says Schaffner. While HV.1 is mutated, it's still very close to the existing omicron subvariants, Schaffner explains.  For the most part, scientists are not concerned about new variants like HV.1, which look very similar to strains we've already seen before,  . However, there are a few highly mutated strains which have set off alarm bells. These include  , which has an extra 36 mutations that differentiate it from XBB.1.5., and a newer variant called JN.1, which has one more mutation than Pirola.  Fortunately, neither BA.2.86 nor JN.1 are common in the U.S. right now,   — JN.1 is so rare that it makes up fewer than 0.1% of SARS-CoV-2 cases. As for HV.1, it rapidly gained steam after it was first detected this past summer. In late July, HV.1 accounted for just 0.5% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.,  . By Sept. 30, HV.1 made up 12.5% of cases, and by November, it was the dominant strain. “One of the characteristics of this entire omicron family is that they are highly transmissible,"" says Schaffner.  Just like other omicron subvariants, HV.1 is highly transmissible, Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic, tells TODAY.com. Sometimes, mutations can enable a new variant to spread more effectively or quickly,  .  Right now, it appears that HV.1 could be better at spreading from person to person than previous strains, NBC News reported. The increased transmissibility of HV.1 likely explains how it became dominant so quickly in the U.S., Schaffner notes. It also appears that HV.1 could also be slightly better at escaping prior immunity to COVID-19, but not enough to cause alarm, Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told NBC News. ""The problem is that most people's immunity has faded from past outbreaks and our vaccine uptake is still very low ... so it's too soon to draw any conclusions about HV.1 (evading) immunity from prior infection or vaccination,"" says Sampathkumar. Although it is more transmissible, HV.1 does not appear to produce more severe disease or lead to more hospitalizations, Schaffer says. What remains unclear is whether HV.1 could cause a major uptick in COVID-19 cases. ""If there's vast numbers of people getting infected, even if the disease for most people isn't very severe, we will see an uptick in hospitalizations and deaths,"" says Sampathkumar.  Health officials are monitoring HV.1 closely, but low levels of testing have made it harder to accurately track new variants, experts note. The symptoms caused by infection with HV.1 are similar to those caused by recent variants, says Schaffner, which include: “Congestion, sore throat and dry cough seem to be the three most prominent symptoms right now,” says Schaffner. Increasingly, doctors report that COVID-19 symptoms appear to follow a pattern of being concentrated in the upper respiratory tract, starting with a sore throat and followed by congestion or a runny nose, NBC news reported. Coughing isn't typically a primary symptom, but it can persist. ""The virus seems to produce a kind of a chronic bronchitis, so that you can have a cough syndrome that lasts beyond the period where you’ve recovered from other symptoms,"" says Schaffner. ""I haven’t really heard of anything very different or any new symptoms that may raise alarms,"" says Sampathkumar. Another trend is that COVID-19 seems to be causing milder illness, likely because people have some prior immunity. “By milder, we mean it doesn’t require hospitalization even though you can feel quite miserable for several days,” says Schaffner.  All COVID-19 tests — including PCR tests performed by a health care provider and rapid at-home antigen tests — will detect HV.1, says Schaffner.  Testing is a crucial tool to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. The symptoms of HV.1 and other COVID-19 variants can look very similar to other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and rhinovirus, which usually causes  . There's no way to tell these viruses apart based on symptoms alone, says Sampathkumar. ""The only way to distinguish (COVID-19) from RSV and flu, both of which are now gaining steam, is by testing,"" says Schaffner. Experts encourage anyone who has symptoms or has been exposed to get tested, especially those in high-risk groups — people over the age of 65, who are immunocompromised or who have underlying health conditions. “We have treatments that can prevent more serious disease,"" says Schaffner, but early detection is key. COVID-19 antivirals such as   are effective against HV.1 and other variants, but they work best when within five days of symptom onset, TODAY.com previously reported. Testing has significantly diminished in the U.S. in the last year, which is concerning, says Schaffner. When the U.S. federal public   in May, so did the guarantee of free testing for many. However, every American can still get COVID-19 tests for free or low-cost right now. One way is to   from the government, which will be delivered by mail via the U.S. Postal Service. To order your free tests, go to  . Additionally, all health insurance plans are required to reimburse eight at-home COVID-19 tests per month, according to  . State Medicaid programs are also required to cover at-home tests, and Medicare beneficiaries and uninsured individuals can access free tests provided by   at thousands of community health centers, clinics and pharmacies.  If you still have a stockpile of tests sitting around, remember to check the expiration date and whether it's been extended by  . The   is recommended by the CDC for everyone ages 6 months and older. It is now widely available at pharmacies, doctor's offices and other locations around the U.S., says Schaffner. The new boosters have been reformulated to target omicron XBB.1.5, which was the dominant COVID variant for most of 2023. While XBB.1.5 has since been overtaken by HV.1, Eris, Fornax and Arcturus, it is still closely related to these newer strains. The updated shots seem to be well-matched to the variants currently circulating and making people sick, Andrew Pekosz, Ph.D., virologist at Johns Hopkins University, previously told TODAY.com. “Laboratory studies indicate that the updated booster will protect against serious disease caused by HV.1,” says Schaffner. Vaccination also significantly lowers the risk of becoming hospitalized or dying,  . As of Nov. 13, only 13.9% of adults and 4.9% of children in the U.S. have gotten the new vaccine, according to data from the  . The first phase of the vaccine rollout hit several speed bumps, including supply delays, high demand, cancelled appointments and insurance obstacles. Some parents have been unable to get their   as some pharmacies and pediatrician's offices have struggled to secure enough child-size doses. Although many of these initial issues have been resolved, says Schaffner, uptake is still slow. ""We've underutilized this updated vaccine, and we anticipate that COVID will once again increase even more during the winter season,"" says Schaffner. It's not too late to take advantage of the new booster, Schaffner adds, and people should get the shot as soon as they can. While people are getting their COVID-19 vaccine, they should get their seasonal flu shot as well, Sampathkumar adds.  The FDA has authorized three vaccine options for 2023-2024: one mRNA shot each from Moderna and Pfizer, and a protein-based non-mRNA shot from Novavax. Insurance plans should cover the updated booster, says Schaffner, and those without insurance should still be able to get the shot for free,  . “We’re in a good place because for a considerable time now, we have not had a new variant that causes more severe disease or evades the protection of currently available vaccines,” says Schaffner. As the winter and holiday season approaches, it's important to take steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 and prevent transmission to others, especially the most vulnerable.

On Nov. 14, TikTok user and baker Jenna (@jennaskates)   showing the considerate thing her chef boyfriend did that brought her to tears: He brought her egg whites. It may sound simple, but the video quickly went viral, garnering more than 14.5 million views. “My boyfriend came home from work and said he had a surprise for me,” Jenna, who uses she/they pronouns, wrote on the video. “We usually surprise eachother with ice cream or a favorite snacks to eat together (the bag was cold so I thought he got ice cream).” After Jenna opens it, she realizes what he brought her — and it brings the baker to tears. “It was egg whites. labeled and dated that he brought from his work (he works in a professional kitchen),” Jenna wrote. “Definitely might seem odd if you don’t know me… but I bake and decorate cakes!!” Indeed, Jenna’s other TikTok videos shows that they are a prolific and talented baker. Jenna posts videos showing cakes baked for   and  , decorating them with immaculate piping and their   method of  , which requires a lot of egg whites. “Just the other night when I was prepping buttercream I was telling him how I hated separating the whites from the yolks,” they wrote. “My longer nails make it hard and that night I was repeatedly popping yolks. And this man took time to pre-separate the egg whites from the yolks for me.” Jenna added that it was “just a little rant” that she didn’t think he’d pay attention to. “But he saw me!” “Never thought egg whites would make me cry,” Jenna wrote, adding that Alexis is always surprising her and supportive of her business and social media accounts. “Truly my biggest supporter ❤️. Thank you baby! ❤️” In the comments section, many people applauded Alexis’ gesture. “to be loved is to be seen,” commented one TikTok user, to which Jenna replied, “Made me burst into tears again.” “thank u for reminding me this love exists,” wrote another. “Because when a man loves you- he solves your problems. You don’t have to ask. ❤️,” wrote another commenter. Many commenters said this video was example of a relationship theory that has recently taken off on TikTok. “orange peel theory,” commented one person, to which Jenna replied, “This. This. This.” “He peeled your orange,” reads the top comment on the video. “next time I see someone asking what the orange peel theory is I’m tagging them in this,” wrote one TikTok commenter. “Orange peel theory” was recently   as identifying the level of trust you have in your partner by seeing how they react to you asking them to do a small task you could easily do yourself — like peeling an orange. “Some people find peeling the orange to be an unpleasant task,” TikToker @neanotmia says in a   posted Nov. 12. “It might not literally be about peeling the orange. More so, they’re asking you for a small favor to see your reaction to see if later they can ask you for bigger favors.” What does Jenna have to say about all the love their relationship has gotten from TikTok? “It’s definitely a little surreal seeing a intimate moment touched so many people. With everything going on in the world right now, it’s clear to me that humans will come together for humanity and empathy,” Jenna, who asked to be referred to by first name only to protect their privacy, tells TODAY.com. “Baking has been incredibly healing and I’m really thankful I have a partner that supports me fully. Knowing you have that one person that has your back changes everything for the things that you are afraid of. I’m so excited to continue creating more content while doing something I love,” she adds. “My boyfriend’s constantly sending me a little update on how the videos doing because we both find it so crazy! He feels really excited about the new community of people that have found my account, that share the same love of baking.” Washington, D.C. native Joseph Lamour is a lover of food: its past, its present and the science behind it. With food, you can bring opposites together to form a truly marvelous combination, and he strives to take that sentiment to heart in all that he does. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

But that doesn't mean that you'll catch her slacking when it comes to   around the holidays. (In fact, we doubt that word is even in her vocabulary.) We got the chance to hop on the phone with the star to talk about the holiday season and her partnership with  , and she clued us in on just how seriously she takes the job of shopping.   ""I love giving gifts and I try to give gifts [that are] really individual and specific to each person, which I think is how you should shop,"" Kardashian shares during an exclusive phone interview with  . ""But it's also torture because I'm literally shopping as soon as Christmas is over. Maybe I take two days of vacation and then I'm like OK, I've got to think for next year."" Of course, anyone who keeps up with her famous family can imagine that they're not the easiest crew to shop for. Of her sisters, she shares that they're all ""really hard"" to  , though she adds that Kim and Kylie are the easiest of the four.  ""They sort of just tell you what they want and I love that,"" Kardashian says. ""Some people might think that's rude, but I'm like, no, just make it simple for me. They'll give me a list and I love that. Kourtney and Kendall, they don't give you any direction. So sometimes that's harder. I think they think it's easier, but I just want you to spell it out for me what you want."" Though she doesn't just take the art of gift-giving seriously for the holidays. Her sister, Kourtney Kardashian Barker recently welcomed a   with husband Travis Barker, and Kardashian revealed to us the sweet   that she gave her. ""It was a late baby shower gift, it was stuck in customs for so long. But I got her this really cute vintage Hermès wooden rocking horse,"" Kardashian shares. ""It's really old school, but it's so her. I think it's more of a decor piece for the room, I don't really think it's something that you use ... it's ridiculous, but I know it's something that she loves."" Beyond picking out  , the Kardashian family has plenty of fun traditions for the season. (We're already wondering what their much-anticipated holiday card will look like this year.) Though Kardashian says that their annual Christmas Eve party is her favorite.  ""We look forward to it every year, we just dance the night away,"" she says. ""I'm not a big drinker anymore, and so I love that it's my time, I have some glasses of champagne, I'm dancing, I'm with my family in this safe space."" For anyone looking for a little inspiration, we asked Kardashian to walk us through some of her top gifts for the holiday season. Some of these products will be on sale during Rakuten's   event, which features daily cash back deals available to shop exclusively on the brand's site. You can learn more about it on the site and follow along on Kardashian’s   story from Nov. 18 through Nov. 22 From the hair tool that makes her feel like a ""professional"" to a cute gift for kids, here are her picks. Shopping for kids? These cute skates, which are adjustable to fit kids' sizes 3 to 6 were featured as one of the picks on her list. As for what her daughter, True Thompson, 5, is asking for this year, Kardashian jokes, ""What is she not asking for?"" Turns out, she's just like other kids her age. ""She loves Bluey, it's a cartoon character, an Australian dog she loves. She's still so into slime. She's really into arts and crafts things, and so I'm all for that. But it's really messy — and fabulous. That, and she wants another cat."" Though Kardashian may not be totally sold on that last idea. ""This is the first time I've owned a cat, so now having two? I just cannot be a cat woman. But we'll see what happens."" Fitness is a big part of Kardashian's personal routine, so we had to know if she had any good ideas on what to get the fitness lover in your life — and of, course, she did.  She shares that was given a gallon reusable water bottle. ""And it sounds ridiculous, but it makes me drink the whole thing through the day instead of refilling up my smaller thermos, like a 12-ounce thermos, every couple hours. And it sort of motivates me to drink my water."" Kardashian adds, ""My girlfriend gave me one for my birthday and she rhinestoned the whole thing, so it was really cute.""  You also can't go wrong with some new workout apparel. ""You could buy someone a great pair of sneakers or workout shoes or things like that,"" she says. ""I think that I feel really good when I'm wearing a cute set of workout clothes or something. I just feel better in the gym. It might sound really cheesy, but it does motivate me."" If you're thinking that a fun reusable water bottle sounds like the perfect gift for your fitness-loving friend (or yourself), we picked out this top-rated option from Amazon. When she doesn't know what to get someone, Kardashian says anything in the ""beauty or home"" space is a pretty safe bet. ""I mean beauty, you just don't want it to be anti-aging or something because then you're sort of indirectly telling someone something,"" she jokes. ""So just be careful with what the beauty [product] says on the outside if you don't want to be too specific ... people are curious about beauty and are willing to try new things, but sometimes people don't want to spend the money so it's always a good gift."" She included this set of Elemis cleansing balms in her gift list. The package comes with three of the brand's bestselling cleansing balms, the original, a fragrance-free version and one with rose oleo extract that's said to be perfect for sensitive skin.  ""Especially in the wintertime, I love really snuggly things, things that are just really soft and plush,"" Kardashian says. ""And I love the look of the faux fur without it being fur. It looks really nice and it's cuddly, but it also, I think, adds the glamour and the drama to any room if you throw it on a chair or a chaise."" ""I love all my Good American dresses,"" Kardashian says. ""We have such great stuff for the holidays, specifically, right now."" Kardashian says that the Dyson Airwrap is ""so easy"" to use. ""I am not great at doing my own hair, and so the Dyson Airwrap really was a game changer for me, and how it sort of makes me look like a real hair professional and I'm not.""

The walking treadmill workout can help you lose weight,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands You may assume that you need to run or spend hours on the treadmill to see results. But a popular exercise routine is proving that  can be an effective way to build your endurance and shed some pounds without requiring a ton of time. What’s known as the 12-3-30 workout, which only requires a treadmill and your legs, can offer the benefits of weight loss, endurance and strength-building, and it’s approachable for people with a range of fitness levels. The best part? The intense workout requires absolutely no running. All you have to do is set your treadmill to an incline of 12 (or a number that feels steep to you), set your speed to 3 miles per hour and  . Research shows  , such as reducing anxiety and depression, combatting some aspects of aging (like the  ), and of course, helping your heart and other internal organs function better. It’s all of these benefits and more that propelled the 12-3-30 workout to viral status in 2020 and make it one of the most popular workouts on social media to this day — especially TikTok, where the hashtag #12330workout has 339 million views. The 12-3-30 workout was first popularized by health and beauty social media influencer Lauren Giraldo, who posted about it on  . A subsequent  , which made the trend explode, has garnered 2.8 million likes. In the clip, Giraldo explains how the treadmill workout helped her lose and keep off about 30 pounds. “I used to be so intimidated by the gym. It wasn’t motivating, but now I go (and) do this one thing and I can feel good about myself,” she said in her viral TikTok. “I look forward to it. It’s my me-time.” Giraldo also revealed to TODAY.com how she came up with the numbers she’s come to rely on. “I’m  , and running on the treadmill was not working for me,” Giraldo said via email. She added that the treadmill at her gym had 12 as its highest incline, 3 miles per hour felt “right” because it was just walking, and her grandma always recommended 30 minutes of exercise daily. Twelve is a steep incline, so unsurprisingly, it took Giraldo a couple of months to start enjoying, and even look forward, to her workout. One thing that kept her going was the fact that 30 minutes just felt so doable: “I found that just focusing on myself for 30 minutes a day was not only great for my body, but also great for my mentality,” she said. A few months after her TikTok went viral, Giraldo shared another video about how the workout has been helping other people, too — not only with weight loss, but with strengthening and creating muscle definition in the   and  . In the comments, many users shared that it’s the steep incline that makes the difference and helps them feel like they’re getting a good workout. If you’re interested in trying the 12-3-30 workout yourself, here’s what to know about whether it’s safe and how to integrate it into your own routine. Giraldo’s workout is guided by three settings on the treadmill: According to Giraldo's TikTok video, she does the workout approximately five times per week and it helped her drop 30 pounds. “I obviously noticed the changes in my body, but I was most happy with the changes that I felt mentally,” she said. “I was proud of myself every day for getting on the treadmill and having my ‘me time’ for 30 minutes. I feel accomplished every time I do it.” For Giraldo it served another important purpose: getting her  . “The thing about 12-3-30 is it made the gym so much less of a scary place. I feel confident in the gym now, and I sometimes   and other exercises into my workout,” she said. So what are the benefits of the 12-3-30 workout? As  , walking comes with a myriad of health benefits including: Improving cardiovascular health and blood pressure, controlling blood sugar and  , increasing your metabolism, aiding in weight loss and maintenance and increasing your aerobic capacity. The   recommends moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 150 to 300 minutes a week. Doing the 12-3-30 workout five times a week will get you into the low end of that range. Walking is also a   alternative to running, which is good for people with joint issues, but adding the incline to your walks increases the intensity and makes it a more challenging workout. It also has toning benefits for the lower body. ""Walking on an incline will engage your leg muscles more than walking on level ground,"" TODAY fitness contributor Stephanie Mansour  . ""This will make for a more intense workout for your glutes, hamstrings and quads, while also increasing your heart rate."" At first, Giraldo couldn’t make it the full 30 minutes. “I definitely had to work up to the 30 minutes. I couldn’t get through it without losing my breath and started out by taking a break after the 10 or 15-minute mark,” she said. Dr. Dennis Cardone, osteopathic sports medicine specialist and chief of primary care sports medicine at NYU Langone Health, told TODAY that this isn’t a workout you should jump right into. “If someone is working that hard with this workout and they are a 20-something, young and healthy, and they are struggling, you see it was a pretty significant workout. It’s just too much too soon and it should really have a recovery day as well,” says Cardone. That’s not to say that there can’t be benefits to adding an incline to your workout. “It certainly adds more stress to a workout in the sense that people are  ; the muscles are working harder,” said Cardone. But, he adds, the risks may outweigh the benefit when it comes to adding a significant incline to your workout. “The problem is people don’t think that walking is a stressor. They think ‘what’s the big deal using an incline? I’m only walking.’ But it really is a big stressor:  , hamstring, Achilles tendon, knee,   … these are the areas where we see some significant injury related to inclining a treadmill,” he said. “As a general observation, anytime anybody begins or changes a workout or adds something like an incline, they have to follow the rule to do it slowly, otherwise they are certainly at significant risk for an  .” Giraldo said that she lost 30 pounds with the 12-3-30 workout and has kept it off for years. According to the  , gradual, steady weight loss of about 1 to 2 pounds per week is optimal for keeping the weight off. ""Generally to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, through a lower calorie diet and regular physical activity,"" according to the  Walking for 30 minutes burns about 125 calories for a 150-pound person — and adding an incline will increase that calorie burn. So with healthy diet changes, the 12-3-30 workout has the potential to   needed for steady, gradual weight loss. “(Giraldo) did well, but most people never make it there because they will get an overuse injury and will be taken out of the game. It’s a great goal, but it’s just not realistic for most of the population,"" said Cardone. ""If you just do one activity — we don’t have to bash just this one — but whatever activity, if you  , it's just a set up for injury.” So instead of jacking that incline way up, here is the safe way to try Giraldo's workout: Even if you’re following these guidelines, the workout should still be done at most, every other day, alternating with other lower-impact activities. In order to get the benefits you seek from any exercise — whether that be  , toning or overall health — the key is to find a program you can stick with, said Cardone. Which means it not only needs to be safe, so you’re not sidelined by an injury, but “it has to be something they enjoy, and if they are only doing one activity they are going to burn out, not just physically, but mentally,” he said.

https://www.today.com/popculture/news/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-history-rcna125664,The history of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree spans all the way back to 1931,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree has stood tall in the heart of New York City ever since the first one was hoisted into place in the 1930s. For the past three decades, the famed tree has been found by  , who started working as a summer helper at Rockefeller Center in 1988. In an interview with Rockefeller Center's online outlet  , Pauze revealed what he looks for when he's searching for a tree. ""What I look for is a tree you would want in your living room, but on a grander scale,"" he said. ""It’s got that nice, perfect shape all around. And most of all, it’s gotta look good for those kids who turn the corner at 30 Rock; it needs to instantly put a huge smile on their faces. It needs to evoke that feeling of happiness."" This year, Pauze found the  , when he was on his way back from looking at another tree.  ""I had driven to the other tree and took a slow road back, and saw this one…,"" he said. ""I went back this spring and decided to knock… The McGinley family told me that not too long before I knocked on the door, someone told them, 'That looks like a Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.'"" That person was right. The McGinley's tree is now being decorated in Rockefeller Center, and on Nov. 29, the annual tree lighting ceremony will be held. Read on to learn the  . In 1931, workers at Rockefeller Center pooled their money together to buy a 20-foot balsam fir, which they decorated with handmade garlands made by their families.  This photo was taken on Christmas Eve and it shows a clerk giving workers their paychecks.  In 1933, the first tree lighting ceremony was held in Rockefeller Center, which marked the beginning of a new tradition.  According to  , the tree that year was a 50-foot pine, which was decorated with 700 lights. During World War II, Rockefeller Center decided to use patriotic designs to decorate their tree.  In 1942, Rockefeller Center erected three small trees, instead of one large one, which were all decorated in red, white and blue colors. However, the trees remained unlit due to blackout regulations, and it stayed that way for each Rockefeller Center Christmas tree until after the war.  In 1999, Rockefeller Center erected its largest tree to date. The record-setting tree came from Killingworth, Connecticut, and it stood 100 feet tall. How’s that for Christmas cheer? Pauze told   that transporting Rockefeller Center Christmas trees is not an easy feat. “Moving the Tree is an operation in and of itself that can take months to plan and execute — from wrapping each branch of the Tree so it doesn’t bend or snap to compressing the width down so it’s fit for travel (to Rockefeller Center),” he said. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Rockefeller Center decided to decorate its tree in red, white and blue. In 2004, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree was topped with a 550-pound Swarovski star that featured 25,000 crystals and 1 million facets.  Just when it didn't seem possible, this star made the tree look even more gorgeous than it was before.  Despite the beauty of the original Swarovski star, another one was made for the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree in 2018. This one was designed by famed architect Daniel Libeskind and it featured 3 million Swarovski crystals, 70 triangular spikes and was backlit by LEDs. This year, Pauze found an 80-foot-tall Norway spruce in Vestal, New York.  “It’s so tall, and it has the perfect shape. I knew when I saw it that it was going to work…,"" Pauze told  . ""I just had to trim the branches up to 5 or 6 feet. It’s a nice shaped tree, and it looks beautiful. When you stand in the street, and look at it against the blue sky, it really looks awesome."" In November, the tree made a nearly 200-mile journey from upstate New York to Rockefeller Center.  The tree will be decorated with more than 50,000 multi-colored LED lights, and a Swarovski crystal star will be the cherry on top. It will all be on full display starting Nov. 29, the night of the Rockefeller Center tree lighting ceremony.  © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Plus, up to 35 people can play, so don't fret if you're hosting a lot of family and friends. You can grab a cute hat for your little one in their favorite color (or at least in one of the 13 shades available). ""My daughter loves this beanie,"" says one five-star reviewer. ""It is super soft and the smiley face is adorable. She usually chooses to wear this beanie over any of her others."" We firmly believe that no one will be upset to find fuzzy socks in their stocking. This set comes with five microfiber pairs that they'll want to wear for the rest of the holiday season.  Acne isn't fun. But these little star patches definitely are. Make the battle against pimples a little less dismal with these ""happy"" hydrocolloid patches that work to suck the gunk out of blemishes and reduce inflammation. Have a coffee lover's stocking to stuff? Stumptown's 100% Organic Arabica option is one to consider, which is described by the brand as a full-body blend that ""combines chocolatey Latin American textures with the brightness of fine east African beans."" We think that translates to: This is delicious. If they love Sol De Janeiro (personally, I think the signature Cheirosa ’62 scent reigns supreme), then this hand cream is a great addition to their stocking. They can pop it in their purse for easy access whenever their hands need moisturizing, or they're just craving that vacation-like fragrance. Be ready. Once these mini toys are out of the stocking, they'll likely be racing around the house nonstop.  Now they bring the music with them anywhere.

Whether you're looking for gifts for a nostalgic millennial or want to see the reaction of an unknowing Gen Z'er, this is one toy we guarantee no one will be able to resist. Instead of buying jewelry, gift them the opportunity to make it! This bead kit (an Oprah's Favorite Things 2023 pick) includes a mix of beads in various shades of purple for crafty flair. Sometimes a $300-plus pair of headphones just isn't in the cards (aka, budget). Luckily, there are just as reliable (and more affordable) options out there to keep the music going. More than 25,000 five-star reviewers on Amazon can attest to this pair for its sound quality, comfortable fit and battery life. If they didn't walk to the Christmas tree in cozy slippers, they'll be happy to walk away from it wearing this brand-new faux fur pair. Not only do they have an irresistibly fuzzy lining, but the cork insole also provides arch support, says the brand. Associaite editor Kamari Stewart wouldn't mind finding this makeup staple in her stocking this year, having already tried (and loved)   before. Stewart has relied on it to keep her makeup looks intact while under bright camera lights, while making it through a packed work itinerary and commuting. He might not think his frayed, worn-out and on-its-last-leg wallet is ready to be replaced, but you know better. Put this genuine leather bifold wallet in his stocking and watch him immediately transfer every card and paper bill. And if he needs an extra push, just tell him it has RFID blocking technology to seal the deal. Everyone needs an emotional support water bottle, and over 115,000 Amazon shoppers are saying this option from Iron Flask is definitely the one.

After trying this nourishing sleep lip mask, you might just add it as a permanent part of your nightly skin care routine. Not only does it make your pout feel soft and moisturized (I can attest!), it's also packed with protective ingredients like vitamin C, Berry Fruit Complex and Murumuru Seed Butter. And if you're still truly stumped about what to get the loved ones in your life, a little gift card can go a long way. Commerce Writer © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/popculture/news/daniel-ricciardo-girlfriend-heidi-berger-rcna125031,All about Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo and girlfriend Heidi Berger,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands Daniel Ricciardo is among the group of Formula One drivers who will be appearing in the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix. Ricciardo   on Nov. 19. This marks the first time that a Formula One race has come to Las Vegas since the 1980s. While Ricciardo's career has put him in the spotlight, especially since the debut of the Netflix docuseries “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” he tends to keep his personal life private, including his relationship with actor Heidi Berger.  Ricciardo and Berger first went public with their relationship in August 2022, with both sharing subtle sneak peeks of one another on their Instagram posts. By September 2022, the Australian driver confirmed his relationship with Berger, revealing that he was in love. The couple has continued to protect their privacy in their relationship, occasionally including a photo of one another in a post on social media for eagle-eyed fans. Though Ricciardo and Berger have maintained a low profile, here’s everything to know about the Formula One driver’s girlfriend. After Berger finished high school, she told Portuguese magazine   in 2016 that she would be taking a year off before she started college to study theater in London.  Berger made her acting debut in 2016 with her first official role in the soap opera “A Única Mulher.” Berger told the magazine that she had sent an audition tape directly to the television channel TVI and was cast as the character Nônô, ultimately appearing in 188 episodes of the show. From 2018 to 2020, she went on to appear in the drama “Onde Está Elisa?” as the titular character Elisa Menezes for 145 episodes.  According to her  , she held several small roles throughout the years, appearing in episodes of “Trakehnerblut,” “Meiberger: Chasing Minds” and “Três Mulheres.” Per her Instagram, she is represented by Buchwald and Conway Van Gelder Grant. Gerhard Berger and Ana Corvo welcomed their eldest daughter, Sara Maria, in 1995. The couple, who were married from 1995 to 2013, welcomed their youngest daughter two years later on April 4, 1997.  Berger's parents had fame of their own, as Corvo was a model and Gerhard Berger was a former Formula One racing driver. According to  , he won 10 Grands Prix across the span of his 14-year career. He raced for several teams over the years, including McLaren, Ferrari, ATS, Arrows and Benetton. Ricciardo spoke about his childhood admiration for Gerhard Berger during a September 2022 appearance on the Australian radio show   When asked if he and his girlfriend’s father ever talked about Formula One and racing with one another, Ricciardo outed himself as a longtime fan of the driver. “It’s funny. When I was young — I followed F1 since I was a kid — and I had a Berger hat,” Ricciardo explained. “I talk about it with him. He still goes to quite a few races. He still has an interest in the sport and he still does some business with it.” Ricciardo said he looks to “any ex-sportsman” — including Berger —  for career advice, explaining, “I just love speaking to them and gaining knowledge and insight through their experience. There’s so much wisdom.” Throughout her life, Heidi Berger has resided in several countries and speaks multiple languages including English, German, Portuguese and French.  She told   in 2018 that she grew up in Monaco, but moved to London after she graduated high school. After that, she relocated to Lisbon, Portugal, for her role in the soap opera “A Única Mulher.” Berger told the outlet she moved to New York City to train and work towards the end of 2018, so she could live with her older sister, who was studying in the city. However, she said it's her dream to move back to Portugal for work. While it's unclear when the couple officially started dating, in August 2022, Ricciardo and Berger subtly went public on social media, sharing sneak peeks of their romance. Ricciardo posted a carousel of photos on his  , providing little context in the caption aside from a tree, smiley face and American flag emoji. In several photos, Ricciardo posted alongside Berger, including a group shot with friends and a solo snap of the actor posing in front of a waterfall. Ricciardo shared insight into his relationship with Berger during his September 2022 appearance on “ ,” confirming the status of their relationship with the radio show’s hosts. When the racer told the hosts that he thought love helped alleviate stress, he was asked if he was currently in love, a question he willingly answered.  “I’m in love. I got a good thing going,” he replied. “I’ve got a good balance in life right now.” Though Berger seldom posts on social media, she has documented several of the couple’s trips throughout their relationship. In August 2022, she shared a video montage on   of their trip to Yosemite National Park. In one clip, she filmed the couple kicking their feet while they sat at the top of a waterfall, followed shortly thereafter by a short clip of Ricciardo taking a dip in the water.  They also captured the picturesque moments from their hike throughout the national park, though Berger expressed in the caption that it was a trip that took her “out of her comfort zone.” In May 2023, Ricciardo and Berger both traveled to Italy for the wedding of Australian snowboarder Scotty James and his wife, singer Chloe Stroll. The racing driver posted a photo of them dressed to the nines from the wedding on   celebrating the newlyweds. Ricciardo and Berger shared more snaps together from their travels on social media, with both posting an adorable photo of the, enjoying a romantic and glamorous boat ride. Ricciardo shared the photo in the seventh frame in a June   post, simply writing, “Bisous” in the caption.  Berger shared it front and center of a May   post, adding in the caption, “Some cute stuff.” Francesca Gariano is a New York City-based freelance journalist reporting on culture, entertainment, beauty, lifestyle and wellness.

https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-testing-holidays-rcna56419,When is the best time to test for COVID-19 before holiday gatherings?,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands As the   kicks off United States, so does another, less enjoyable winter tradition: respiratory virus season.  Although COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have been trending downward in recent weeks, experts anticipate infections will rise again, as they have for the last few winter seasons. Ahead of a potential surge driven by  , health officials are urging Americans to get the   to protect against serious disease outcomes. As of Nov. 13, only 13.9% of adults and 4.9% of children in the U.S. have gotten the new shot, according to data from the  . Officials are also recommending people get their seasonal influenza vaccine as flu season begins and cases start to rise across the country. Meanwhile, viruses that cause cold symptoms such as rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are also circulating. Last winter, a spike in COVID-19 infections coincided with an  , as well as a severe   among children, which was dubbed a  ."" The coming weeks will present many opportunities for these highly contagious respiratory viruses to spread as people travel and gather with loved ones for holiday festivities. Given that these viruses can all cause similar upper respiratory symptoms (coughing, runny nose, sore throat, to name a few) it will be nearly impossible tell what's making you sick just based on how you feel. That's why at-home testing remains a critical tool to protect yourself and others. Knowing your COVID-19 status is especially important if you are planning to visit or spend time unmasked with high-risk individuals, like elderly family members. But which type of COVID-19 test should you take? And when should you take it before a gathering? We spoke to experts about how and when to use COVID-19 tests to stay safe. The current   are that anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms should test immediately, and anyone who is exposed to COVID-19 should test five days after exposure.  include congestion, runny nose, sore throat, cough, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, fever, shortness of breath and loss of taste or smell, TODAY.com previously reported.  If neither of the above conditions apply to you, the decision to test ahead of a gathering comes down to several factors, as well as the comfort level of those around you, according to experts. “I would first look at what your recent risk is ... because the more you've been at risk, the more likely you're going to have a positive test,"" Dr. Scott Weisenberg, infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health, told TODAY.com. If you’ve been engaging in higher risk activities, like spending time in crowded indoor areas without a mask or hanging around sick people, that will increase your chances of having any respiratory virus, Weisenberg noted. Next, you should consider who is going to be attending the gathering. “If people are concerned about the consequences of infection for vulnerable individuals, particularly elderly or people with compromised immune systems, then they really want to make plans to try to minimize respiratory virus transmission,” said Weisenberg. This includes COVID-19 testing but also masking, distancing and ventilation, Weisenberg added. In any case, there's really no downside to taking a COVID-19 test out of precaution before going to an event or being around high-risk people, the experts noted.  There are two types of COVID-19 tests: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and antigen tests.  “If you want to be absolutely sure, the more sensitive test is the PCR test,” Dr. Thomas Murray, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital in Connecticut, told TODAY. These are the most reliable tests for people with or without symptoms,  , but they are usually performed in a laboratory, so it takes longer (up to three days) to get results. The ideal timing for taking a PCR test depends on how fast you can get the test results back, said Murray. “If you can find a place that has a 24 to 48 hour turnaround, then a couple of days before the event is ideal,” said Murray. While waiting for the PCR results, people can opt to take extra precautions like wearing a mask or isolating, said Murray, especially if they are going to see someone who’s very high risk.  It’s important to note PCR tests can   or even months after a person recovers from COVID-19, the experts pointed out. “It doesn’t necessarily correlate with infectiousness,” said Weisenberg, because the more sensitive PCR tests can detect remnants of the virus and produce a positive result long after a person is contagious. Anyone who thinks they are in this situation should speak to their health care provider, said Weisenberg. Additionally, people should check with their insurance provider about the cost of PCR testing beforehand. “In many places, symptomatic testing remains covered but asymptomatic screening may not be covered,” said Murray. Additionally, coverage and policies around testing may have changed since the   for COVID-19 this May. The next best choice are rapid at-home antigen tests, said Murray, and the closer to the time of the gathering you take it the better — for example, if you're meeting family for Christmas Eve dinner, do it that morning. “There is some evidence that if you do more than one (rapid) test in the two days leading up, and those are both negative, then that’s better than a single test,” Murray added.  If you're traveling, get tested as soon as possible before leaving and then when you arrive at your destination, recommended NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar. Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when used by people with symptoms, said Murray. “That’s probably because asymptomatic individuals don’t have as high of a viral load, so the (rapid) test doesn’t pick it up. … It’s not as good at detecting smaller amounts of virus.” Rapid tests also work best when they are performed exactly as instructed, said Murray. It's important to read the directions closely and check the testing kit’s expiration date, TODAY previously reported. Some expiration dates have been extended by the  . For an extra level of safety, you can take a PCR test a day or two before a gathering and an antigen test right before, said Weisenberg. Everyone can still   from the government, which will be delivered by mail via the U.S. Postal Service.  All health insurance plans are required to reimburse eight at-home COVID-19 tests per month, according to  . State Medicaid programs also cover at-home tests, and Medicare beneficiaries and uninsured individuals can access free tests from   at community health centers, clinics and pharmacies. In any case, a negative COVID-19 test does not 100% guarantee that you are not infected with the virus and you won’t transmit it to others, said Weisenberg. But it does offer a snapshot of your SARS-CoV-2 status in that moment, the experts noted, which is why testing is important to help prevent transmission. Anyone who is testing negative but still has symptoms should stay home until they are feeling better, the experts emphasized. Even if it's not COVID-19, it could be any number of respiratory viruses — which may cause a mild cold for a healthy person but a severe illness for a vulnerable person, said Weisenberg. “If you’re sick, don’t go to gatherings, period.” You may also consider going to the doctor to get an influenza test, said Murray, because the   are often difficult to tell apart and you don't want to spread the flu either. If you’re still concerned about being around high-risk individuals, the experts recommend dialing up the precautions: wearing a mask, distancing, opening windows to allow ventilation and holding events outdoors. “If you’re able to afford it, an appropriate-sized portable HEPA filtration (system) can be very helpful if you’re going to engage in unmasked activities like (Christmas) dinner,” said Murray. One of the best ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 is by making sure you are up to date with your vaccinations, the experts noted. The   is recommended by the CDC for everyone ages 6 months and older and provides good protection against newer variants. It's not too late to get the new booster if you haven't already. “Reduce the risk of getting infected and then subsequently transmitting the virus to people by getting the vaccinated,” said Weisenberg.  Everyone ages 6 months and older should also get their seasonal flu shot, the experts said. Caroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

A small team from the sanctuary and a few Swifties started distributing the food and drink to those in need that evening. “Young people like challenges. So we directed the energy of fans to do good,” said Raposo, who also is pastor of Rio’s São José da Lagoa parish. “This can and will be replicated!

I would make up the report sometimes because A, the coach wouldn’t come out at halftime or it was too late and I was like, ‘I didn’t want to screw up the report,’ so I was like, ‘I’m just going to make this up,’” the 41-year-old said.  Thompson noted that she felt comfortable doing so because her comments weren’t far off from what a coach might actually say in an interview. “First of all no coach is going to get mad if I say, ‘Hey, we need to stop hurting ourselves, we need to be better on third down, we need to stop turning the ball over and do a better job of getting off the field.’ Like, they’re not going to correct me on that,” she explained. “So I’m like it’s fine, I’m just going to make up the report.” NBC News has reached out to Thompson, Fox and Amazon for comment. Thompson’s comments quickly sparked backlash from peers in her field. Fox Sports broadcaster Laura Okmin, who is Thompson’s colleague, Thursday: “Devastated w/the texts I’m getting asking if this is ok. No. Never.” “THE privilege of a sideline role is being the 1 person in the entire world who has the opportunity to ask coaches what’s happening in that moment. I can’t express the amount of time it takes to build that trust,” she added. CBS Sports broadcaster Tracy Wolfson called Thompson’s podcast comments, “absolutely not ok, not the norm and upsetting on so many levels.” “I take my job very seriously, I hold myself accountable for all I say, I build trust with coaches and never make something up. I know my fellow reporters do the same,” Wolfson  .  ESPN broadcaster Molly McGrath tweeted a warning to young reporters saying: “This is not normal or ethical. Coaches and players trust us with sensitive information, and if they know that you’re dishonest and don’t take your role seriously, you’ve lost all trust and credibility.” NBC Sports’ Kathryn Tappen denounced Thompson’s comments as   and Emmy-award winning sports journalist Andrea Kremer  , “I’m sickened by the insulting mockery being made of sideline reporting, a challenging role primarily manned by women — most of whom understand & respect the values of journalism and are integral, trusted members of a broadcast team.” On X, former NFL network host Lindsay Rhodes responded to a tweet that asked what Thompson was supposed to do if a coach declined comment and she still had to speak on the broadcast. Rhodes replied: “She tells the producer, ‘he didn’t stop’ and they don’t go to the sideline reporter for an update she doesn’t have. OR, she tells the audience that in her report. Or she observes things herself & reports them without misleading anyone into thinking it came from someone it didn’t.” Thompson addressed the controversy on Friday, writing on  , “I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster.” “I have a responsibility to myself and my employers to clarify what is being reported. When on a podcast this week, I said I would make up reports early in my career when I worked as a sideline reporter before I transitioned to my current host role,” she said. “Working in media I understand how important words are and I chose the wrong words to describe the situation. I’m sorry.” She explained that if a coach didn’t provide information for her reports, “I would use information that I learned and saw during the first half to create my report.” “For example if a team was 0 for 7 on 3rd down, that would clearly be an area they need to improve on in the second half. In these instances I never attributed anything I said to a player or coach,” Thompson wrote. She concluded by saying, “I have nothing but respect for sideline reports and for the tireless work they put in behind the scenes and on the field.” Marlene Lenthang is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"
https://www.today.com/parents/babies/world-prematurity-day-rcna125714,World prematurity day: Dad shares advice for other parents of preemies,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands World Prematurity Day is Nov. 17: One in 10 babies are born prematurely in the U.S., according to the March of Dimes. Scientists don't always know what causes premature birth, and early birth can cause life-threatening complications, the March of Dimes says, as well as lifelong medical issues. For parents, having a baby born prematurely can be terrifying, but parents are not alone.  Chris Murphy was one of those parents: His son, Remy, was born prematurely. After an uneventful pregnancy, Remy came early with multiple health problems and needed surgery in his first 24 hours of life to survive. “I wish I would have had better insight into how difficult it was going to be,” Murphy said. “You never really can prepare for a preemie. It just kind of happens."" Murphy and other parents offered TODAY.com advice that they wish they'd known before their child was born prematurely. “The NICU is an amazing place and they do wonders there. It is also a very scary and traumatizing place,” Murphy said. Murphy thought he could handle the stress alone. But watching Remy fight for his life in the NICU for four months felt too overwhelming. Murphy said he started drinking, gained weight and lashed out at his family before asking for support. “I should have gotten a therapist right away,” he said. “No matter how strong you think you are mentally, you will break down.” When Steve Michener’s wife, Carissa, delivered their daughter at 24 weeks pregnant, he felt scared. His daughter, Claire, weighed 1 pound, 9 ounces, and her skin was so thin he could see her heart beating through her chest. During her two months in the NICU, he often thought Claire was dying but felt confused. He wished he would have pestered the doctors more. “We didn’t know what questions to ask,” the dad from Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, told TODAY. “I was definitely out of my league.” When Mike Ryan’s wife, Natalie, gave birth to their daughter Juliet at 33 weeks, the couple worried. Their questions often received conflicting answers from doctors. “That was the biggest frustration,” Ryan, who lives in Pittsburgh, told TODAY. “Each doctor has a different opinion and that is why things changed a little bit daily.” But the couple realized that their doctors knew what was best. “We said ‘Let’s trust the doctors and trust what they are saying. This is their profession. They know what they are doing better than us,’” he said. Daniel Corbin’s son, Noah, was born 5 weeks early and he, too, felt frustrated by the varied opinions he and his wife, Meghan, heard. While they worried about taking advice from the wrong person, they soon realized that they knew what their son needed. “Take into account some of various subtly conflicting messages from the doctors … and go with your gut,” Corbin, from Pittsburgh, told TODAY.com. After bringing Claire home after two months in the NICU, Michener and his wife had to return to work. But they weren’t sure who could watch Claire, who was still dependent on oxygen. Their local teen babysitter wasn’t qualified and even experienced nannies felt hesitant. “Your average babysitter is either not qualified or comfortable,” he said. “Who do you trust to watch your child?” Luckily, the couple found an older woman who didn’t balk at Claire’s medical needs. When Brody Gilbert’s son, Cooper, was born at 32 weeks he only weighed 3 pounds 2 ounces. Gilbert worried holding him could hurt him. “I would have loved to try something out in a risk-free environment,” Gilbert, of Monongahela, Pennsylvania, told TODAY. “It was definitely intimidating.” When the nurses explained how skin-to-skin contact would help Cooper thrive, Gilbert knew he had to hold his tiny son. “I was excited in a nervous way,” he said. Michener had a similar realization about holding his daughter: “They are not as breakable as I always thought.” Chris Murphy struggled with feeling helpless and scared. “I was on a rollercoaster of emotion,” he said. “I wish I would have had a better insight into … how difficult it was really going to be.” Brody Gilbert grappled with his feelings, too. “I have never felt more powerless in my life,” he said. “Your emotions do get the best of you.” And Daniel Corbin experienced doubts: “I didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing.” “There’s a light at the end of the tunnel,” said Murphy. Even though Remy’s had 15 surgeries, including a stent in his brain, he is a happy, active kid. When he was almost 6 months old, Cooper weighed 17 pounds and was “perfectly healthy, happy,” his dad said. Claire taught herself how to ride a bike and makes her parents nervous because she’s so “physically strong and strong-willed.” Noah is thriving. And Juliet graduated pre-kindergarten — dressed as Batgirl.

https://www.today.com/popculture/music/rain-k-pop-jung-ji-hoon-rcna125020,K-pop icon Rain wants to ‘remember the memories’ he shared with his fans during his U.S. tour,"Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands The singer is returning to the U.S. for his first shows in 15 years. Here, he reflects on his successful career.  There's a smile on Rain's face as he begins to share how he's making his highly anticipated return to the U.S. after nearly 15 years.  Before there were K-pop   — and member   —  ,  ,   and Seventeen, among others, Rain was the K-pop sensation paving the way for the South Korean genre.  Rain, whose real name is Jung Ji-hoon, has been making music since he was 16 years old, in addition to starring in hit K-dramas and movies like ""Speed Racer"" and ""Ninja Assassin."" Now, the 41-year-old is celebrating his decades-long career by sharing his music with U.S. fans. throughout his “Still Raining” tour.  “I’m so excited,” Rain says in English via Zoom, before speaking in Korean. A translator was present for our TODAY.com interview. “I missed my fans in the U.S. ... I’m just really happy to be able to perform again. K-pop has become a global genre.”  Born in Seosan, South Korea, Rain's given name is Jung Ji-hoon. The artist began his career in 1998 as part of the boy band Fanclub. When the group didn't gain commercial success, he embarked on his solo career.  The name Rain, he tells TODAY.com, was given to him by his producer J. Y. Park, founder of JYP Entertainment.  “It had two kinds of meanings, because in Korean it means precipitation — like water and rain,” he explains. “But it also has the meaning of 'something was sad.' It has the meaning of sadness.” “And he told me that the way I danced kind of looked sad, so it had a double meaning,” he continues. “But then later I just used it as a proper noun so that people can remember me whenever it rains and think of me, be reminded of me, when it rains.” Rain's breakthrough happened with his third studio album, “It’s Raining.” Released in 2004, the album and title track made him an international success — even getting recognition in the U.S.  By 2006, he was featured on Time’s 100 Most Influential and made another appearance on the list in 2011.  K-pop wasn’t at the stature that it appears to be in current times, but one could say that Rain was the Korean act to know.   even called him “a pioneer of the Hallyu wave,” the name used to describe increases in international interest in Korean pop culture. His mandatory military service in 2011 was also covered by the  , decades before interest in  .  His music and dance moves aren’t just what attracted universe love. His role in the hit Asian drama “Full House” (2004) made him a TV star and cemented his title as a triple threat. Then there was his crossover, with appearances in Hollywood films like “Speed Racer,” “Ninja Assassin” and “The Prince,” starring Bruce Willis and John Cusack. Amid Rain's blossoming career and gaining superstardom, he also fell in love. The artist maintains a relatively private personal life, rarely sharing photos of his wife, actor Kim Tae-hee, or their 6-year-old and 4-year-old daughters.  Rain and Tae-hee began dating in 2013. During an episode of his web variety show “Season B Season” in 2020, he shared how it ""took one year"" for his wife to fall for him.  “I asked her out first, and it took a long time to get her to say yes,” he said, according to  . “It took one year.” Rain and Tae-hee would go on to get married on Jan. 19, 2017, holding a small wedding at a Catholic church, per  . They welcomed their first child, a daughter, in October of that year.  The couple are also parents to a second daughter, whom they welcomed in September 2019. They have yet to share their daughters' names.  While they keep their children out of the public eye, Rain and Tae Hee have worked together on various projects. The couple have been in commercials together for   and massage chair brand  , showing off their love for one another. In just a matter of weeks, Rain will be bringing his “Still Raining” tour to the U.S. This will be his first tour since 2016, and his first shows in the states in 15 years.  “I am preparing really hard for this upcoming concert and my music will be a mix of retro and trending music,” he says, “So (fans) will be able to enjoy it a lot. And one other unique point is that I’ll be singing other artists’ songs for the first time.” The singer’s first stop is at the Hard Rock Live at Etess Arena in   on Nov. 22. He will follow it up by performing Nov. 25 at the MGM Grand Arena in  . Tickets are still available online.  Rain shares that the shows will run for over two hours and “have a lot of exciting footage, many songs and dances.” Among those include songs by Bruno Mars and K-pop group NewJeans. The concerts are described as “a blend of heart-pounding beats, entrancing melodies, and dazzling visuals,” that will make longtime fans nostalgic, while also an entertaining introduction to new fans.  “Still Raining” is produced by Infinite Prospects Entertainment who brought the BTS concerts to Allegiant Stadium and the inaugural We Bridge Music Festival & Expo.  “I just want to remember the memories that I shared with my fans in the past,” he continues. “I want to do music again. I want to just have fun and enjoy this stage with my fans.” Rain iterates “K-pop has become so huge globally now.” “It’s really hard to work with all the dancer teams as well. They, themselves, have become celebrities,” he says amid preparing for his own shows.  With social media platforms connecting people around the world, Rain believes his early hits could’ve gone viral.  “I have a song called ‘Rainism’ and if ‘Rainism’ had been released today, then I think it would have gone a lot more viral on TikTok, Reels, on Instagram,” he says. “People would be able to sing along, dance along.” Fans will have plenty of opportunities to create dance challenges on social media. Rain teases that he has a new album that he's working on and hopes to release it in March.  “It’s very easy to listen to songs and afro-beat kind of music,” he says, before adding, “I’ll be shaking my bottom a lot.” Reminiscing about his breakout role in “Full House,” he jokes that he’s “too old” for romantic comedies — despite telling him that he is most certainly not.  The 2004 rom-com series followed an aspiring scriptwriter whose friends trick her into thinking she won a vacation and secretly sell her home, called “Full House.” While on her trip, she meets a famous actor, played by Rain, and they become friendly.  However, when she returns home, she discovers that she is now homeless and that he has bought her home. A romance ensues.  These days, he says, “If I were to act again, I want to be involved in action or thrillers, or very emotional characters. I want to be acting out those deep characters.” It appears he will be mixing both romance and suspense in his upcoming drama, “Red Swan,” where he will portray a bodyguard to  a rich family. “I’m looking forward to that,” he says.   (Nov. 21, 2023, 7:22 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated that Rain appeared in “Along With the Gods” and “The Last 49 Days.”  Liz Calvario is a Los Angeles-based reporter and editor for TODAY.com who covers entertainment, pop culture and trending news. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

One commenter prompted over 21,000 likes, writing, ""Use this as a grieving button for his curls. -------->"" referring to the heart-shaped like button.  The announcement of Styles' buzz cut came shortly after   reported that the 29-year-old was spotted in Las Vegas with what appeared to be a shaved head. Earlier this month, fans went crazy when another   of Styles’ new cut went viral online.  This isn't the first time Styles has made headlines for his hair, though. The ""Late Night Talking"" performer was deemed a teen heartthrob with his messy bowl cut in his initial years with One Direction.  In subsequent years, Styles' curls continued to grow past his shoulders until he debuted a fierce cut in 2017, which some fans felt was James Bond-inspired. Since then, Styles has experimented with similar dos, including a more effortless and laid back coiffed look when he starred in ""Don't Worry Darling.""
